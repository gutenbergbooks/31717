<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">What</span> the Witches of New York City personally told me,
Doesticks, you will find written in this volume, without the
slightest exaggeration or perversion. I set out now with no
intention of misrepresenting anything that came under my
observation in collecting the material for this book, but with
an honest desire to tell the simple truth about the people I
encountered, and the prophecies I paid for.</p>

<p>So far from desiring to do any injustice to the Fortune Tellers
of the Metropolis, I sincerely hope that my labors may
avail something towards making their true deservings more
widely appreciated, and their fitting reward more full and
speedy. I am satisfied that so soon as their character is better
understood, and certain peculiar features of their business
more thoroughly comprehended by the public, they will meet
with more attention from the dignitaries of the land than has
ever before been vouchsafed them.</p>

<p>I thank the public for the flattering consideration paid to
what I have heretofore written, and respectfully submit that
if they would increase the obligation, perhaps the readiest way
is to buy and read the present volume.</p>

<hr />

in which the author takes occasion to pay himself<br />

<h2>CHAPTER I.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></h2>

<hr />

<h3>WHICH IS MERELY EXPLANATORY.</h3>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> first undertaking of the author of these pages
will be to convince his readers that he has not set
about making a merely funny book, and that the
subject of which he writes is one that challenges
their serious and earnest attention. Whatever of
humorous description may be found in the succeeding
chapters, is that which grows legitimately out of
certain features of the theme; for there has been no
overstrained effort to <i>make</i> fun where none naturally
existed.</p>

<p>The Witches of New York exert an influence too
powerful and too wide-spread to be treated with such
light regard as has been too long manifested by the
community they have swindled for so many years;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and it is to be desired that the day may come when
they will be no longer classed with harmless mountebanks,
but with dangerous criminals.</p>

<p>People, curious in advertisements, have often read
the “Astrological” announcements of the newspapers,
and have turned up their critical noses at the
ungrammatical style thereof, and indulged the while
in a sort of innocent wonder as to whether these
transparent nets ever catch any gulls. These matter-of-fact
individuals have no doubt often queried in a
vague, purposeless way, if there really can be in
enlightened New York any considerable number of
persons who have faith in charms and love-powders,
and who put their trust in the prophetic infallibility
of a pack of greasy playing-cards. It may open the
eyes of these innocent querists to the popularity of
modern witchcraft to learn that the nineteen she-prophets
who advertise in the daily journals of this city are
visited every week by an average of <i>sixteen hundred
people</i>, or at the rate of more than a dozen customers
a day for each one; and of this immense number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
probably two-thirds place implicit confidence in the
miserable stuff they hear and pay for.</p>

<p>It is also true that although a part of these visitors
are ignorant servants, unfortunate girls of the town,
or uneducated overgrown boys, still there are among
them not a few men engaged in respectable and
influential professions, and many merchants of good
credit and repute, who periodically consult these
women, and are actually governed by their advice in
business affairs of great moment.</p>

<p>Carriages, attended by liveried servants, not unfrequently
stop at the nearest respectable corner adjoining
the abode of a notorious Fortune-Teller, while
some richly-dressed but closely-veiled woman stealthily
glides into the habitation of the Witch. Many
ladies of wealth and social position, led by curiosity,
or other motives, enter these places for the purpose
of hearing their “fortunes told.” When these ladies
are informed of the true character of the houses they
have thus entered, and the real business of many of
these women whose fortune-telling is but a screen to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
intercept the public gaze from it, it is not likely that
any one of them will ever compromise her reputation
by another visit.</p>

<p>People who do not know anything about the subject
will perhaps be surprised to hear that most of
these humbug sorceresses are now, or have been in
more youthful and attractive days, women of the
town, and that several of their present dens are vile
assignation houses; and that a number of them are
professed abortionists, who do as much perhaps in
the way of child-murder as others whose names have
been more prominently before the world; and they
will be astonished to learn that these chaste sibyls
have an understood partnership with the keepers of
houses of prostitution, and that the opportunities for
a lucrative playing into each other’s hands are constantly
occurring.</p>

<p>The most terrible truth connected with this whole
subject is the fact that the greater number of these
female fortune-tellers are but doing their allotted part
in a scheme by which, in this city, the wholesale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
seduction of ignorant, simple-hearted girls, in the
lower walks of life, has been thoroughly systematized.</p>

<p>The fortune-teller is the only one of the organization
whose operations may be known to the public; the
other workers—the masculine go-betweens who lead
the victims over the space intervening between her
house and those of deeper shame—are kept out of
sight and are unheard of. There is a straight path
between these two points which is travelled every
year by hundreds of betrayed young girls, who, but
for the superstitious snares of the one, would never
know the horrible realities of the other. The exact
mode of proceeding adopted by these conspirators
against virtue, the details of their plans, the various
stratagems by which their victims are snared and led
on to certain ruin, are not fit subjects for the present
chapter; but any individual who is disposed to prosecute
the inquiry for himself will find in the various
police records much matter for his serious cogitation,
and may there discover the exact direction in which
to continue his investigations with the certainty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
demonstrating these facts to his perfect satisfaction.</p>

<p>A few months ago, at the suggestion of the editor
of one of the leading daily newspapers of America,
a series of articles was written about the fortune-tellers
of New York city, and these articles were in due
time published in that journal, and attracted no little
attention from its readers. These chapters, with such
alterations as were requisite, and with many additions,
form the bulk of this present volume.</p>

<p>The work has been conscientiously done. Every
one of the fortune-tellers described herein was personally
visited by the “Individual,” and the predictions
were carefully noted down at the time, word for
word; the descriptions of the necromantic ladies and
their surroundings are accurate, and can be corroborated
by the hundreds who have gone over the same
ground before and since. They were treated in the
most fair and frank manner; the same data as to time
and date of birth, age, nationality, etc., were given in
all cases, and the same questions were put to all, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
that the absurd differences in their statements and predictions
result from the unmitigated humbug of their
pretended art, and from no misinformation or misrepresentation
on the part of the seeker after mystic
knowledge.</p>

<p>This latter person was perfectly unknown to the
worthy ladies of the black art profession; he was to
them simply an individual, one of the many-headed
public, a cash customer, who paid liberally for all he
required, and who, by reason of the dollars he disbursed,
was entitled to the very best witchcraft in the
market.</p>

<p>And he got it.</p>

<p>He undertook a few short journeys in search of the
marvellous; he went on a couple of dozen voyages
of discovery without going out of sight of home; he
penetrated to the out-of-the-way regions, where the
two-and-sixpenny witches of our own time grow. He
got his fill of the cheap prophecy of the day, and procured
of the oracles in person their oracularest sayings,
at the very highest market price. For the business-like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
seers of this age are easily moved to prophesy
by the sight of current moneys of the land, no matter
who presents the same; whereas the oracles of the
olden time dealt only with kings and princes, and
nothing less than the affairs of an entire nation, or a
whole territory, served to get their slow prophetic
apparatus into working trim. To the necromancers
of early days the anxieties of private individuals were
as naught, and from the shekels of humble life they
turned them contemptuously away.</p>

<p>It is probably a thorough conviction of the necessity
of eating and drinking, and a constant contemplation
from a Penitentiary point of view of the consequences
of so doing without paying therefor, that
induces our modern witches to charge a specific sum
for the exercise of their art, and to demand the
inevitable dollar in advance.</p>

<p>Whatever there is of Sorcery, Astrology, Necromancy,
Prophecy, Fortune-telling, and the Black Art
generally, practised at this time by the professional
Witches of New York, is here honestly set down.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Should any other individual become particularly
interested in the subject, and desire to go back of the
present record and make his exploration personally
among the Fortune-tellers, he will find their present
addresses in the newspapers of the day, and can easily
verify what is herein written.</p>

<p>With these remarks as to the intention of this book,
the reader is referred by the Cash Customer to the
succeeding chapters for further information. And the
public will find in the advertisements, appended to the
name and number of each mysteriously gifted lady, the
pleasing assurance that she will be happy to see, not
only the Cash Customer of the present writing, but
also any and all other customers, equally cash, who
are willing to pay the customary cash tribute.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

trade of Fortune Telling, and has been professionally
known to the police and the public of New York for
about fourteen years. The amount of evil she has
accomplished in that time is incalculable, for she has
been by no means idle, nor has she confined her attention
even to what mischief she could work by the
exercise of her pretended magic, but if the authenticity
of the records may be relied on, she has borne a
principal part in other illicit transactions of a much
more criminal nature. She has been engaged in the
“Witch” business in this city for more years than
has any other one whose name is now advertised
to the public.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>If the history of her past life could be published,
it would astound even this community, which is not
wont to be startled out of its propriety by criminal
development, for if justice were done, Madame Prewster
would be at this time serving the State in the
Penitentiary for her past misdoings; but, in some of
these affairs of hers, men of so much <i>respectability</i>
and political influence have been implicated, that,
having sure reliance on their counsel and assistance,
the Madame may be regarded as secure from punishment,
even should any of her many victims choose
to bring her into court.</p>

<p>The quality of her Witchcraft, by which she ostensibly
lives, and the amount of faith to be reposed
in her mystic predictions, may be seen from the
history of a visit to her domicile, which is hereunto
appended in the very words of the “Individual” who
made it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>


<h4>The “Cash Customer” makes his first Voyage in a Shower,
but encounters an Oily and Waterproof Witch at the
end of his Journey.</h4>

<p>It rained, and it <i>meant</i> to rain, and it set about it
with a will.</p>

<p>It was as if some “Union Thunderstorm Company”
was just then paying its consolidated attention
to the city and county of New York; or,
as if some enterprising Yankee of hydraulic tendencies,
had contracted for a second deluge and was
hurrying up the job to get his money; or, as if the
clouds were working by the job; or, as if the earth
was receiving its rations of rain for the year in a
solid lump; or, as if the world had made a half-turn,
leaving in the clouds the ocean and rivers, and
those auxiliaries to navigation were scampering back
to their beds as fast as possible; or, as if there had
been a scrub-race to the earth between a score or
more full-grown rain storms, and they were all coming
in together, neck-and-neck, at full speed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Despite the juiciness of these opening sentences,
the “Individual” does not propose to accompany
the account of his heroical setting-forth on his first
witch-journey with any inventory of natural scenery
and phenomena, or with any interesting remarks on
the wind and weather. Those who have a taste for
that sort of thing will find in a modern circulating
library, elaborate accounts of enough “dew-spangled
grass” to make hay for an army of Nebuchadnezzars
and a hundred troops of horse—of “bright-eyed
daisies” and “modest violets,” enough to fence all
creation with a parti-colored hedge—of “early larks”
and “sweet-singing nightingales,” enough to make
musical pot-pies and harmonious stews for twenty
generations of Heliogabaluses; to say nothing of the
amount of twaddle we find in American sensation
books about “hawthorn hedges” and “heather bells,”
and similar transatlantic luxuries that don’t grow in
America, and never did.</p>

<p>And then the sunrises we’re treated to, and the
sunsets we’re crammed with, and the “golden clouds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>”
the “grand old woods,” the “distant dim blue mountains,”
the “crystal lakes,” the “limpid purling
brooks,” the “green-carpeted meadows,” and the
whole similar lot of affected bosh, is enough to shake
the faith of a practical man in nature as a natural
institution, and to make him vote her an artificial
humbug.</p>

<p>So the voyager in pursuit of the marvellous,
declines to state how high the thermometer rose or
fell in the sun or in the shade, or whether the wind
was east-by-north, or sou’-sou’-west by a little sou’.</p>

<p>The “dew on the grass” was not shining, for there
was in his vicinity no dew and no grass, nor anything
resembling those rural luxuries. Nor was it by any
means at “early dawn;” on the contrary, if there be
such a commodity in a city as “dawn,” either early
or late, that article had been all disposed of several
hours in advance of the period at which this chapter
begins.</p>

<p>But at midday he set forth alone to visit that prophetess
of renown, Madame Prewster. He was fully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
prepared to encounter whatever of the diabolical
machinery of the black art might be put in operation
to appal his unaccustomed soul.</p>

<p>But as he set forth from the respectable domicile
where he takes his nightly roost, it rained, as aforementioned.
The driving drops had nearly drowned
the sunshine, and through the sickly light that still
survived, everything looked dim and spectral. Unearthly
cars, drawn by ghostly horses, glided swiftly
through the mist, the intangible apparitions which
occupied the drivers’ usual stands hailing passengers
with hollow voices, and proffering, with impish finger
and goblin wink, silent invitations to ride. Fantastic
dogs sneaked out of sight round distant corners, or
skulked miserably under phantom carts for an imaginary
shelter. The rain enveloped everything with a
grey veil, making all look unsubstantial and unreal;
the human unfortunates who were out in the storm
appeared cloudy and unsolid, as if each man had sent
his shadow out to do his work and kept his substance
safe at home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The “Individual” travelled on foot, disdaining
the miserable compromise of an hour’s stew in a steaming
car, or a prolonged shower-bath in a leaky omnibus.
Being of burly figure and determined spirit, he
walked, knowing that his “too-solid flesh” would
not be likely “to melt, thaw, and resolve itself into
a dew,” and firmly believing that he was not born to
be drowned.</p>

<p>He carried no umbrella, preferring to stand up and
fight it out with the storm face to face, and because he
detested a contemptible sneaking subterfuge of an
umbrella, pretending to keep him dry, and all the
time surreptitiously leaking small streams down the
back of his neck, and filling his pockets with indigo
colored puddles; and because, also, an umbrella
would no more have protected a man against that
storm, than a gun-cotton overcoat would have availed
against the storm of fire that scorched old Sodom.</p>

<p>He placed his trust in a huge pair of water-proof
boots, and a felt hat that shed water like a duck. He
thrust his arms up to his elbows into the capacious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
pockets of his coat, drew his head down into the
turned-up collar of that said garment, like a boy-bothered
mud-turtle, and marched on.</p>

<p>With bowed head, set teeth, and sturdy step, the
cash customer tramped along, astonishing the few
pedestrians in the street by the energy and emphasis
of his remarks in cases of collision, and attracting
people to the windows to look at him as he splashed
his way up the street. He minded them no more than
he did the gentleman in the moon, but drove forward
at his best speed, now breaking his shins over a dry-goods
box, then knocking his head against a lamp-post;
now getting a great punch in the stomach from
an unexpected umbrella, then involuntarily gauging
the depth of some unseen puddle, and then getting
out of soundings altogether in a muddy inland sea;
now swept almost off his feet by a sudden torrent of
sufficient power to run a saw-mill, and only recovering
himself to find that he was wrecked on the curbstone
of some side street that he didn’t want to go to.
At length, after a host of mishaps, including some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
interesting but unpleasant submarine explorations in
an unusually large mud-hole into which he fell full-length,
he arrived, soaked and savage, at the house of
Madame Prewster.</p>

<p>This elderly and interesting lady has long been an
oily pilgrim in this vale of tears. The oldest inhabitant
cannot remember the exact period when this
truly great prophetess became a fixture in Gotham,
and began to earn her bread and butter by fortune-telling
and kindred occupations. Her unctuous countenance
and pinguid form are known to hundreds on
whose visiting lists her name does not conspicuously
appear, and to whom, in the way of business, she has
made revelations which would astonish the unsuspecting
and unbelieving world. She is neither exclusive
nor select in her visitors. Whoever is willing to pay
the price, in good money—a point on which her regulations
are stringent—may have the benefit of her
skill, as may be seen by her advertisement:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Card.</span>—Madame <span class="smcap">Prewster</span> returns thanks to her friends and
patrons, and begs to say that, after the thousands, both in this
city and Philadelphia, who have consulted her with entire satisfaction,
she feels confident that in the questions of astrology,
love, and law matters, and books or oracles, as relied on constantly
by Napoleon, she has no equal. She will tell the name
of the future husband, and also the name of her visitors. No.
373 Bowery, between Fourth and Fifth streets.”</p></div>

<p>The undaunted seeker after mystic lore rang a peal
on the astonished door-bell that created an instantaneous
confusion of the startled inmates. There was a
good deal of hustling about, and running hither, thither,
and to the other place, before any one appeared;
meantime, the dainty fingers of the damp customer
performed other little solos on the daubed and sticky
bell-pull,—and he also amused himself with inspection
of, and comments on, the German-silver plate on the
narrow panel, which bore the name of the illustrious
female who occupied these domains.</p>

<p>At last the door was opened by a greasy girl,
and the visitor was admitted to the hall, where he
stood for a minute, like a fresh-water merman, “all
dripping from the recent flood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>”</p>

<p>The juvenile female who had admitted him thus
far, evidently took him for a disreputable character,
and stood prepared to prevent depredations.
She planted herself firmly before him in the narrow
hall in an attitude of self-defence, and squaring off
scientifically, demanded his business. Astrology was
mentioned, whereupon the threatening fists were lowered,
the saucy under-jaw was retracted, and the
general air of pugnacity was subdued into a very
suspicious demeanor, as if she thought he hadn’t any
money, and wanted to storm the castle under false
pretences. She informed him that before matters
went any further, he must buy tickets, which she
was prepared to furnish, on receipt of a dollar and a
half; he paid the money, which transaction seemed
to raise him in her estimation to the level of a man
who might safely be trusted where there was nothing
he could steal. One fist she still kept loaded, ready
to instantly repel any attack which might be suddenly
made by her designing enemy, the other hand
cautiously departed petticoatward, and after groping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
about some time in a concealed pocket, produced
from the mysterious depth a card, too dirty for
description, on which these words were dimly
visible:</p>


<table summary="card" style="width: 18em; border: black dotted 2px; padding: 0.5em; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em">
<tr><td>50&nbsp;cents.</td><td><span class="smcap">MADAME PREWSTER<br />
411 Grand Street</span>.</td><td>No.&nbsp;1.</td></tr>
</table>


<p>The belligerent girl then led the way through a
narrow hall, up two flights of stairs into a cold room,
where she desired her visitor to be seated. She then
carefully locked one or two doors leading into adjoining
rooms, put the keys in her pocket, and departed.
Before her exit she made a sly demonstration with
her fists and feet, as if she was disposed to break
the truce, commence hostilities, and punch his unprotected
head, without regard to the laws of honorable
warfare. She departed, however, at last, without violence,
though the voyager could hear her pause on
each landing, probably debating whether it wasn’t<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
best after all to go back and thrash him before the
opportunity was lost for ever.</p>

<p>This grand reception-room was an apartment about
six feet by eight; it was uncarpeted, and was luxuriously
furnished with six wooden chairs, one stove,
with no spark of fire, one feeble table, one spittoon,
and two coal-scuttles.</p>

<p>The view from the window was picturesque to
a degree, being made up of cats, clothes-lines, chimneys,
and crockery, and occasionally, when the storm
lifted, a low roof near by suggested stables. The
odor which filled the air had at least the merit of
being powerful, and those to whose noses it was
grateful, could not complain that they did not get
enough of it. Description must necessarily fall far
short of the reality, but if the reader will endeavor to
imagine a couple of oil-mills, a Peck-slip ferry-boat, a
soap-and-candle manufactory, and three or four bone-boiling
establishments being simmered together over
a slow fire in his immediate vicinity, he may possibly
arrive at a faint and distant notion of the greasy fragrance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in which the abode of Madame Prewster is
immersed.</p>

<p>For an hour and a half by the watch of the Cash
Customer (which being a cheap article, and being alike
insensible to the voice of reason and the persuasions
of the watchmaker, would take its own time to do its
work, and the long hands of which generally succeeded
in getting once round the dial in about eighty
minutes) was this too damp individual incarcerated
in the room by the order of the implacable Madame
Prewster.</p>

<p>He would long before the end of that time have
forfeited his dollar and a half and beaten an inglorious
retreat, but that he feared an ambuscade and a
pitching-into at the fair hands of the warlike servant.</p>

<p>Finally, this last-named individual came to the
rescue, and conducted him by a circuitous route, and
with half-suppressed demonstrations of animosity, to
the basement. This room was evidently the kitchen,
and was fitted up with the customary iron and
brazen apparatus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>A feeble child, just old enough to run alone, had
constructed a child’s paradise in the lee of the cooking-stove,
and was seated on a dinner-pot, with one
foot in a saucepan; it had been playing on the
wash-boiler like a drum, but was now engaged in
decorating some loaves of unbaked bread with bits
of charcoal and splinters from the broom.</p>

<p>The fighting servant retreated to the far end of the
apartment, where she began to wash dishes with vindictive
earnestness, stopping at short intervals to wave
her dish-cloth savagely as a challenge to instant single
combat. There was nothing visible that savored of
astrology or magic, unless some tin candlesticks with
battered rims could be cabalistically construed.</p>

<p>Madame Prewster, the renowned, sat majestically
in a Windsor rocking-chair, extra size, with a large
pillow comfortably tucked in behind her illustrious
and rheumatic back. Her prophetic feet rested on a
wooden stool; her oracular neck was bound with a
bright-colored shawl; her necromantic locomotive
apparatus was incased in a great number of predictive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
petticoats, and her whole aspect was portentous.
She is a woman who may be of any age from 45 to
120, for her face is so oily that wrinkles won’t stay
in it; they slip out and leave no trace. She is an
unctuous woman, with plenty of material in her—enough,
in fact, for two or three. She is adipose
to a degree that makes her circumference problematical,
and her weight a mere matter of conjecture.
Moreover, one instantly feels that she is thoroughly
water-proof, and is certain that if she could be
induced to shed tears, she would weep lard oil.</p>

<p>Grim, grizzled, and stony-eyed, is this juicy old
Sibyl; and she glared fearfully on the hero with her
fishy optics, until he wished he hadn’t done anything.</p>

<p>She was evidently just out of bed, although it was
long past noon, and when she yawned, which she did
seven times a minute on a low average, the effect was
gloomy and cavernous, and the timid delegate in
search of the mysterious trembled in his boots.</p>

<p>At last, he with uncovered head and timid
demeanor presented his card entitling him to twelve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
shillings’ worth of witchcraft, and made an humble
request to have it honored. He had previously,
while pretending to warm himself at the stove, been
occupied in making horrible grimaces at the baby,
and then sketching it in his hat as it disfigured its
own face by frantic screams; and he also took a
quiet revenge on the pugnacious servant by making
a picture of her in a fighting attitude, with one eye
bunged and her jaw knocked round to her left ear.</p>

<p>When the ponderous Witch had got all ready for
business, and had taken a very long greasy stare at
her customer, as if she was making up her mind
what sort of a customer on the whole he might be,
she determined to begin her mighty magic. So she
took up the cards, which were almost as greasy as
she herself, and prepared for business, previously
giving one most tremendous yawn, which opened
her sacred jaws so wide that only a very narrow
isthmus of hair behind her ears connected the top
of her respected head with the back of her venerated
neck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>She then presented the cards for her customer to
cut, and when he had accomplished that feat, which
he did in some perturbation, she ran them carelessly
over between her fingers, and began to speak very
slowly, and without much thought of what she was
about, as if it was a lesson she had learned by heart.</p>

<p>Each word slipped smoothly out from her fat lips
as if it had been anointed with some patent lubricator,
and her speech was as follows:—</p>

<p>“You have seen much trouble, some of it in business,
and some of it in love, but there are brighter
days in store for you before long—you face up a letter—you
face up love—you face up marriage—you
face up a light-haired woman, with dark eyes, you
think a great deal of her, and she thinks a great deal
of you; but then she faces up a dark complexioned
man, which is bad for you—you must take care and
look out for him, for he is trying to injure you—she
likes you the best, but you must look out for the
man—you face up better luck in business, you face a
change in your business, but be careful, or it will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
bring you much money—you do not face up a great
deal of money.”</p>

<p>(Here followed a huge yawn which again nearly
left the top of her head an island.) Then she resumed,
“If you will tell me the number of letters in
the lady’s name, I will tell you what her name is.”</p>

<p>This demand was unexpected, but her cool and
collected customer replied at random, “Four.” The
she-Falstaff then referred to a book wherein was
written a long list of names, of varying lengths from
one syllable to six, and selecting the names with four
letters, began to ask.</p>

<p>“Is it Emma?” “No.” “Anna?” “No.” “Ella?”
“No?” “Jane?” “No.” “Etta?” “No.” “Lucy?”
“No.” “Cora?” “No.” At last, finding that she
would run through all the four-letter names in the
language, and that he must eventually say something,
he agreed to let his “true love’s” name be
Mary. Then she continued her remarks: “You face
up Mary, you love Mary; Mary is a good girl. You
will marry Mary at last; but Mary is not now here—Mary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
is far away; but do not fear, for you shall
have Mary.”</p>

<p>Then she proposed to tell the name of our reporter
in the same mysterious manner, and on being told
that it contains eight letters, the first of which is “M,”
she turned to her register and again began to read.
It so happens that the proper names answering to the
description are very few, and the right one did not
happen to be on her list; so in a short time the
greasy prophetess became confused, and slipped off
the track entirely, and after asking about two hundred
names of various dimensions, from Mark to
Melchisedek, she gave it up in despair and glared
on her twelve-shilling patron as if she thought he was
trifling with her, and she would like to eat him up
alive for his presumption.</p>

<p>Then she suddenly changed her mode of operation
and made the fearful remark: “Now you may wish
three wishes, and I will tell whether you will get
them or not.”</p>

<p>She then laid out the cards into three piles, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
her visitor stated his wishes aloud, and received the
gratifying information in three instalments, that he
would live to be rich, to marry the light-haired
maiden, and to effectually smash the dark-complexioned
man.</p>

<p>Then she said: “You may now wish one wish in
secret, and I will tell you whether you will get it.”
Our avaricious hero instantly wished for an enormous
amount of ready money, which she kindly
promised, but which he has not yet seen the color of.</p>

<p>He asked about his prospective wives and children,
with unsatisfactory results. One wife and four children
was, she said, the outside limit. At this juncture
she began to wriggle uneasily in her chair, and her
considerate patron respected her “rheumatics” and
took his leave. This conference, although the results
may be read by a glib-tongued person in five
minutes, occupied more than three-quarters of an
hour—Madame Prewster’s diction being slow and
ponderous in proportion to her size.</p>

<p>He now prepared to depart, and with a parting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
contortion of his countenance, of terrible malignity,
at the unfortunate baby, which caused that weird brat
to fling itself flat on its back and scream in agony of
fear, he informed the Madame with mock deference
that he would not wait any longer. He was then
attended to the door by the bellicose maiden, who
seemed to have fathomed his deep dealings with the
infuriate infant, and to be desirous of giving him
bloody battle in the hall, but as he had remarked that
she had a rolling-pin hidden under her apron, and
as he was somewhat awed by the sanguinary look of
her dish-cloth, he choked down his blood-thirstiness
and ingloriously retreated.</p>

<hr />

<h3>MADAME BRUCE, “THE MYSTERIOUS VEILED
LADY,” No. 513 BROOME STREET.</h3>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> woman who assumes the title of “The Mysterious
Veiled Lady,” is much younger in the Black
Art trade than Madame Prewster, and has only been
publicly known as a “Fortune-Teller” for about six
years. The mysterious veil is assumed partly for the
very mystery’s sake, and partly to hide a countenance
which some of her visitors might desire to identify on
after occasions. She confines herself more exclusively
to telling fortunes than do many of the others, and
has never yet made her appearance in a Police Court
to answer to an accusation of a grave crime. She
has many customers, and might have a respectable
account at the bank if she were disposed to commit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
her moneys to the care of those careful institutions.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned here, however, as a curious
fact, that although all the “witches” profess to be able
to “tell lucky numbers,” and will at any time give a
paying customer the exact figures which they are willing
to prophesy will draw the capital prize in any
given lottery, their skill invariably fails them when
they undertake to do anything in the wheel-of-fortune
way on their own individual behalf. No one of
the professional fortune-tellers was ever known to
draw a rich prize in a lottery, or to make a particularly
lucky “hit” on a policy number, notwithstanding
the fact that most of them make large investments
in those uncertain financial speculations. Madame
Bruce is no exception to this general rule, and the
propinquity of the “lottery agency” and the “policy-shop,”
just round the corner, must be accepted in
explanation of the fact that this gifted lady has no
balance in her favor at the banker’s.</p>

<p>The quality of her magic and other interesting facts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
about her are best set forth in the words of the
anxious seeker after hidden lore, who paid her a visit
one pleasant afternoon in August.</p>


<h4>The “Individual” visits Madame Bruce and has a Conference
with that Mysterious Veiled Personage.</h4>

<p>A man of strong nerves can recover from the
effects of a professional interview with the ponderous
Prewster in about a week; delicately organized persons,
particularly susceptible to supernatural influences,
might be so overpowered by the manifestations
of her cabalistic lore as to affect their appetites for a
whole lunar month, and have bad dreams till the
moon changed; but the daring traveller of this veracious
history was convalescent in ten days. It is true,
that, even after that time, he, in his dreams, would
imagine himself engaged in protracted single combats
with the heroine of the rolling-pin, and once or twice
awoke in an agony of fear, under the impression that he
had been worsted in the fight, and that the conquering
fair one was about to cook him in a steamer, or stew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
him into charity soup, and season him strong with red
pepper; or broil him on a gridiron and serve him up
on toast to Madame Prewster, like a huge woodcock.
In one gastronomic nightmare of a dream he even
fancied that the triumphant maiden had tied him, hand
and foot, with links of sausages, then tapped his head
with an auger, screwed a brass faucet into his helpless
skull, and was preparing to draw off his brains in
small quantities to suit cannibalic retail customers.</p>

<p>But he eventually recovered his equanimity, his
nocturnal visions of the warlike servant became less
terrible, and he gradually ceased to think of her, except
with a dim sort of half-way remembrance, as of
some fearful danger, from which many years before
he had been miraculously preserved.</p>

<p>When he had reached this state of mind, he was
ready to proceed with his inquiries into the mysteries
of the cheap and nasty necromancy of the day, and
to encounter the rest of the fifty-cent Sybils with an
unperturbed spirit. Accordingly, he girded up his
loins, and prepared the necessary amount of one dollar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
bills; for, with a most politic and necessary carefulness,
he always made his own change.</p>

<p>[Note of caution to the future observer of these
Modern Witches: Never let one of them “break” a
large bank-bill for you, and give you small notes in
exchange, lest the small bills be much more badly
broken than the large one. Not that the witches’
money, like the fairies’ gold, will be likely to turn
into chips and pebbles in your pocket, but all these
fortune-tellers are expert passers of counterfeit and
broken bank-notes and bogus coin; and they never
lose an opportunity thus to victimize a customer.]</p>

<p>Fortified with dinner, dessert, and cigars, the cash
customer departed on his voyage of discovery in
search of “<span class="smcap">Madame Bruce, The Mysterious Veiled
Lady</span>,” who carries on all the business she can get by
the subjoined advertisement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Astonishing to All.</span>-Madame <span class="smcap">Bruce</span>, the Mysterious Veiled
Lady, can be consulted on all events of life, at No. 513 Broome
st., one door from Thompson. She is a second-sight seer, and
was born with a natural gift.”</p></div>

<p>The “Individual,” modestly speaking of himself in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the third person, admits that, being then a single man
of some respectability, he was at that very period
looking out for a profitable partner of his bosom, sorrows,
joys, and expenses. He naturally preferred one
who could do something towards taking a share of the
expensive responsibility of a family off his hands,
and was not disposed to object to one who was even
afflicted with money;—next to that woman, whom he
had not yet discovered, a lady with a “natural gift”
for money-making was evidently the most eligible of
matrimonial speculations. Whether he really cherished
an humble hope that the veil of Madame Bruce
might be of semi-transparent stuff, and that she might
discover and be smitten by his manly charms, and ask
his hand in marriage, and eventually bear him away,
a blushing husband, to the altar, or whatever might be
hastily substituted for that connubial convenience,
will never be officially known to the world. Certain
it is that he expected great results of some sort to
eventuate from his visit to this obnubilated prophetess,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and that he paid extraordinary attention to the decoration
of the external homo, and to the administration
of encouraging stimuli to the inner individual, probably
with a view to submerge, for the time, his characteristic
bashfulness, before he set out to visit the fair
inscrutable of Broome-street.</p>

<p>The nature of his secret cogitations, as he walked
along, was somewhat as follows, though he himself
has never before revealed the same to mortal man.</p>

<p>He was of course uncertain as to her personal
attractiveness; owing to that mysterious veil there
was a doubt as to her surpassing beauty. At any
rate he did not regret the time spent on his toilet.</p>

<p>Madame Bruce might be a lady of the most transcendent
loveliness, or she might possess a countenance
after the style of Mokanna, the Veiled Prophet;
in either case, a clean shirt collar and a little
extra polish on the boots would be a touching tribute
of respect. He thought over the stories of the Oriental
ladies, so charmingly and complexly described
in the “Arabian Nights’ Entertainments,” and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
some strange way he connected Madame Bruce with
Eastern associations; he remembered that in Asiatic
countries the arts of enchantment are the staple of
fashionable female education; that the women imbibe
the elements of magic from their wet nurses, and that
their power of charming is gradually and surely developed
by years and competent instructors, until
they are able to go forth into the world, and raise the
devil on their own hook.</p>

<p>In this case the veil was of the East, Eastern; and
what was more probable than that the “Mysterious
Veiled Lady” was that fascinating Oriental young
woman whose attainments in magic made her the dire
terror of her enemies, most of whom she changed into
pigs, and oxen, and monkeys, and other useful domestic
animals; who had transformed her unruly grandfather
into a cat of the species called Tom; had metamorphosed
her vicious aunt into a screech-owl, and
had turned an ungentlemanly second-cousin into a
one-eyed donkey.</p>

<p>What a treasure, thought the “Individual,” would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
such an accomplished wife be in republican America,—how
exceedingly useful in the case of her husband’s
rivals for Custom-house honors, and how invaluable
when creditors become clamorous. What a
perfect treasure would a wife be who could turn a
clamorous butcher into spring lamb, and his brown
apron and leather breeches into the indispensable peas
and mint-sauce to eat him with; who could make the
rascally baker instantly become a green parrot with
only power to say, “Pretty Polly wants a cracker;”
who could transform the dunning tailor into a greater
goose than any in his own shop; who could go to
Stewart’s, buy a couple of thousands of dollars’ worth
of goods, and then turn the clerks into cockroaches,
and scrunch them with her little gaiter if they interfered
with her walking off with the plunder; or who,
in the event of a scarcity of money, could invite a
select party of fifty or sixty friends to a nice little
dinner, and then change the whole lot into lions,
tigers, giraffes, elephants, and ostriches, and sell the
entire batch to Van Amburgh &amp; Co. at a high premium,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
as a freshly imported menagerie, all very fat
and valuable.</p>

<p>Then he came down from this rather elevated flight
of fancy, and filled away on another tack. Before he
reached the house he had fully made up his mind
that Madame Bruce, the Mysterious Veiled Lady,
must be a stray Oriental Princess in reduced circumstances,
cruelly thrust from the paternal mansion by
the infuriated proprietor, her father, and compelled to
seek her fortune in a strange land. He had never
seen a princess, and he resolved to treat this one with
all respect and loyal veneration; to do this, if possible,
without compromising his conscience as a republican
and a voter in the tenth ward,—but to do it at
all hazards.</p>

<p>The immense fortune which would undoubtedly be
hers in the event of the relenting of her brutal though
opulent father, suggested the feasibility of a future
elopement, and a legal marriage, according to the
forms of any country that she preferred—he couldn’t
bethink him of a Persian justice of the peace, but he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
did not despair of being able to manage it to her
entire and perfect satisfaction.</p>

<p>Her undoubted great misfortunes had touched his
tender heart. He would see this suffering Princess—he
would tender his sympathy and offer his hand and
the fortune he hoped she would be able to make for
him. If this was haughtily declined there would
still remain the poor privilege of buying a dose of
magic, paying the price in current money, and letting
her make her own change.</p>

<p>Having matured this disinterested resolve, he proceeded
calmly on his journey, wondering as he walked
along, whether, in the event of a gracious reception
by his Princess, it would be more courtly and correct
to kneel on both knees, or to make an Oriental cushion
of his overcoat and sit down cross-legged on the floor.</p>

<p>This knotty point was not settled to his entire
satisfaction when he reached that lovely portion of
fairy-land near the angle of Broome and Thompson
streets. The Princess had taken up her temporary
residence in the tenant-house No. 513 Broome,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
which, elegant mansion affords a refuge to about
seventeen other families, mostly Hibernian, without
very high pretensions to aristocracy.</p>

<p>His ring at the door of the noble mansion was
answered by a grizzly woman speaking French very
badly broken, in fact irreparably fractured. This
grizzly Gaul let him into the house, heard his request
to see Madame Bruce, and then she called to a shock-headed
boy who was looking over the bannisters, to
come and take the visitor in charge.</p>

<p>Two minutes’ observation convinced the distinguished
caller that the servants of the Princess were
not particular in the matter of dirt.</p>

<p>The walls were stained, discolored, and bedaubed,
and the floor had a sufficient thickness of soil for a
vegetable garden; at one end of the hall, indeed, an
Irish woman was on her knees, making experimental
excavations, possibly with a view to planting early
lettuce and peppergrass.</p>

<p>A glance at the shock-headed boy showed a
peculiarity in his visual organs; his eyes, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
were black naturally, had evidently suffered in some
kind of a fisticuff demonstration, and one of them
still showed the marks; it was twice black, naturally
and artificially; it had a dual nigritude, and might,
perhaps, be called a double-barrelled black eye. This
pleasant young man conducted his visitor to the top
of the first flight of stairs, where he said, “Please
stop here a minute,” and disappeared into the Princess’s
room, leaving her devoted slave alone in the
hall with two aged washtubs and a battered broom.
There ensued an immediate flurry in the rooms of
the Princess, and the customer thought of the forty
black slaves, with jars of jewels on their heads, who,
in Oriental countries, are in the habit of receiving
princesses’ visitors with all the honors. He hardly
thought to see the forty black slaves, with the jars of
gems, but rather expected the shock-headed youth
to presently reappear, with a mug of rubies, or a
kettle of sapphires and emeralds, and invite him in
courtly language to help himself to a few—or, that
that active young man would presently come out with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
an amethyst snuff-box full of diamond-dust and ask
him to take a pinch, and then present him with that
expensive article as a slight token of respect from
the Princess.</p>

<p>“Not so, not so, my child.”</p>

<p>The great shuffling and pitching about of things
continued, as if the furniture had been indulging in an
extemporaneous jig, and couldn’t stop on so short a
notice, or else objected to any interruption of the
festivities.</p>

<p>Finally the rattling of chairs and tables subsided
into a calm, and the boy reappeared. He came, however,
without the tea-kettle full of valuables, and
minus even the snuff-box; he merely remarked, with
an insinuating wink of the lightest-colored eye,
“Please to walk this way.”</p>

<p>It <i>did</i> please his auditor to walk in the designated
direction, and he entered the room, when the eye
spoke again to a very low accompaniment of the
voice, as if he was afraid he might damage that organ
by playing on it too loudly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The anxious visitor looked for the Princess, but
not seeing her, or the slaves with the pots of jewels,
and observing, also, that the chairs were not too luxuriously
gorgeous for people to sit on, he sat down.</p>

<p>A single glance convinced him that the Princess
could have had no opportunity to carry off her jewels
from her eastern home, or that she must have spent
the proceeds before she furnished her present domicile.
An iron bedstead, a small cooking-stove, four
chairs, and a table, on which the breakfast crockery
stood unwashed, was the amount of the furniture. A
dirty slatternly young woman of about twenty-three
years, with filthy hands and uncombed hair, and whose
clothes looked as if they had been tossed on with a
pitchfork, seated herself in one of the chairs and commenced
conversation—not in Persian. It was one
o’clock, <small>P.M.</small>, but she attempted an apology for the
unmade bed, the unswept room, the unwashed breakfast
dishes, and the untidy appearance of everything.
Before she had concluded her fruitless explanation,
the boy with the variegated eye suddenly came from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
a closet which the customer had not noticed and was
unprepared for, and said, in winning tones, “Please
to walk in this room,” which was done, with some
fear and no little trembling, whereupon the optical
youth incontinently vanished.</p>

<p>At last, then, the imaginative visitor stood in the
presence of royalty, and beheld the wronged Princess
of his heart. He was about to drop on his bended
knees to pay his premeditated homage, but a hurried
glance at the floor showed that such a course of proceeding
would result in the ineffaceable soiling of his
best pantaloons; so he stood sturdily erect.</p>

<p>Before he suffered his eyes to rest upon the peerless
beauty who, he was convinced, stood before him, he
took a survey of the regal apartment.</p>

<p>An unpainted pine table stood in the corner, a gaudily
colored shade was at the window, and an iron
single bedstead upon which the clothes had been hastily
“spread up,” and two chairs, on one of which sat
the enchantress, completed the list.</p>

<p>The Princess was attired in deep black, and a thick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
black veil, reaching from her head to her waist, entirely
concealed her features from the beholders who
still devoutly believed in her royal birth and cruel
misfortunes—nor was this belief dissipated until she
spoke; but when she called “Pete” to the double-barrelled
youth with the eye, and gave him a “blowing
up” in the most emphatic kind of English for not
bringing her pocket-handkerchief, then the beautiful
Princess of his imagination vanished into the thinnest
kind of air, and there remained only the unromantic
reality of a very vulgar woman, in a very dirty
dress, and who had a very bad cold in her head.
There was still a hope that she might be pretty, and
her would-be admirer fervently trusted that she might
be compelled to lift her veil to blow her nose, but she
didn’t do it. Then he offered her his hand, not in
marriage, but for her to read his fortune in, and stood,
no longer trembling with expectation, but with stony
indifference, for as he approached her, a strong odor
of an onion-laden breath from beneath the veil, gave
the death-blow to the fair creature of his imagination,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and convinced him that he had got the wrong ——
Princess by the fist. She looked at him closely for a
couple of minutes, and then spoke these words—the
peculiar pronunciation being probably induced by the
cold in her head.</p>

<p>“You are a badd who has saw a great beddy chadges
add it seebs here as if you was goidg to be bore
settled in the future—it seebs here like as if you had
sobetibes in your life beed very buch cast dowd, but

as they preted to be—you are goidg to bake sub

you add will cub out buch better thad you expect.”</p>

<p>Here she stopped and intimated that she would answer
any questions that her customer desired to ask,
and in reply to his interrogatories the following important
information was elicited:</p>

<p>“You will be lodg lived, add you will have two
wives, add will live beddy years with your first wife.”</p>

<p>The “Individual” proclaimed himself satisfied, and
paid his money, whereupon Madame Bruce instantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
yelled “Pete,” when the Eye-Boy reappeared to show
the door, and the Cash Customer departed, leaving the
Mysterious Veiled Lady shivering on her stool, and
exceedingly desirous of an opportunity to use her
pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>And this is all there was of the Persian Princess.
As the seeker after wisdom went away he made one
single audible remark by way of consoling himself for
his crushed hopes and blighted anonymous love. It
was to this effect. “I believe she squints, and I <i>know</i>
she’s got bad teeth.”</p>

<hr />

<h3>MADAME WIDGER, No. 3 FIRST AVENUE.</h3>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Madame Widger</span> came from Albany to this city
about four years ago, and at once set up as an “Astrologer.”
She has been a “witch” for a great many
years, and has, directly and indirectly, done about as
much mischief as it is possible for one person to accomplish
in the same length of time. She was a woman
of great repute in and about Albany, as a fortune-teller,
and was supposed to be conversant with practices
more criminal. She at last became so well
known as a bad woman, that she found it advisable to
leave Albany, after she had settled certain lawsuits in
which she had become entangled.</p>

<p>Among other speculations of hers, in that place,
she once sued the city to recover indemnifying moneys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
for certain imaginary damages, alleged to have
been done to her property by the unbidden entrance
of the river into her private apartments, during one
of the periodical inundations with which Albany is
favored. By the shrewd management of certain of
her lawyer friends with whom she had business dealings,
she at last got a judgment against the city, but,
owing to some other awkward law complications, it
became expedient to change her place of residence
before she had collected her money, and the amount
remains unpaid to this day.</p>

<p>She then came to this city, and set up in the Sorceress
way, and, by dint of advertising, she soon got a
good many customers. She now has as much to do
as she can easily manage to get along with, is making
a good deal of money by “Astrology,” and by other
more unscrupulous means; and she is probably worth
some considerable property. She is a bold, brazen,
ignorant, unscrupulous, dangerous woman. She has
some peculiar ways of her own in telling the fortunes
of her visitors, and is the only person in the city who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
professes to read the future through a magic stone, or
“second-sight pebble.” Her manner of using this
wonderful geological specimen is fully described hereafter.</p>


<h4>The “Individual” Visits a Grim Witch, who reads his Future
through a Moderate-Sized Paving-Stone.</h4>

<p>Disappointed in his fond hope of discovering, in the
person of Madame Bruce, an eligible partner, who
should bridal him and lead him coyly to the altar,
that bourne from which no bachelor returns, the Cash
Customer was for many days downcast in his demeanor
and neglectful of his person. When he eventually
recovered from his strong attack of Madame Bruce,
he was not by any means cured of his romantic
desire to procure a witch wife. He had carefully
figured up the conveniences of such an article, and
the sum total was an irresistible argument.</p>

<p>If he could win a witch of the right sort, perhaps
she could teach him the secret of the Philosopher’s
Stone, and the Elixir of Life, and show him the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
locality of the Fountain of Youth, so that he could
take the wrinkles out of himself and his friends, at
the cost of only a short journey by rail-road. A barrel
or so of that wonderful water, peddled out by the
bottle, would meet a readier sale and pay a larger
profit than any Paphian Lotion that was ever advertised
on the rocks of Jersey. All this, to say nothing
of a family of young wizards and sorcerers, who could,
by virtue of the maternal magic, swallow swords from
the day of their birth, do mighty feats of legerdemain,
such as cutting off the heads of innumerable pigs and
chickens, and producing the decapitated animals alive
again from the coat-tails of the bystanders, to the
astonishment of the crowd and the great emolument
of their proud dad. Even if these profitable babies
should not be natural necromancers, with the power
of second sight, and any quantity of “natural gifts,”
they must surely be spirit-rappers of the most lucrative
“sphere,” capable of organizing “circles,” and
instructing “mediums,” and otherwise bringing into
the family fund large piles of that circulating medium<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
so much to be desired. Or, even failing this
popular gift, they <i>must</i> all be born with some strong
instincts of money-making vagabondism. If the girls
failed in fortune-telling they would certainly have a
genius for the tight-rope, or a decided talent for the
female circus and negro-minstrel business; and the
boys would be brought into the world with the power
of throwing a miraculous number of consecutive flip-flaps—of
putting cocked hats on their juvenile heads
while turning somersets over long rows of Arab
steeds of the desert—of poising their infant bodies on
pyramids of bottles, and drinking glasses of molasses
and water, under the contemptible subterfuge of wine,
to the health of the terror-stricken beholders—or of
climbing to the tops of very tall poles without soiling
their spangled dresses, and there displaying their
anatomy for the admiration of the gazing multitude,
in divers attitudes, for the most part extraordinarily
wrong side up with very particular care—or, at least,
they would be born with the astounding gift of tying
their young legs in double bow-knots across the backs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of their adolescent necks, and while in that graceful
position kissing their little fingers to the bewildered
audience.</p>

<p>Under the constant influence of such comfortable
and ennobling thoughts, it is not in the elastic nature
of the human mind to remain long dejected. In the
contemplation of the future glories of his might-be
wife and possible family, the “Individual” recovered
somewhat of his former gaiety. Remembering that
“Care killed a cat,” he resolved that he would not be
chronicled as a second victim, so he kicked Care out
of doors, so to speak, and warned Despair and Discouragement
off the premises.</p>

<p>He attired him in his best, and appeared once
more before the world in the joyful garb of a man
with Hope in his heart and money in his pantaloons.
In fact, so radiant did he appear, that he might have
been set down for a person who had just had a new
main of joy laid on in his heart, and had turned the
cocks of all the pipes, and let on the full head just
to see how the new apparatus worked. Or, as if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
he’d been in a shower-bath of good-nature, and
come out dripping.</p>

<p>He also took kindly to that innocuous beverage,
lager bier, which was a good sign in itself, inasmuch
as he had, for a few days, been drinking as
many varieties of strong drinks, as if he’d been
brought up on Professor Anderson’s Inexhaustible
Bottle, and had never overcome the influences of his
infant education.</p>

<p>Seeking out a friend to whom he confided his
hopes of a lucrative wife and a profitable progeny,
the Cash Customer suggested that they proceed immediately
in search of the fair enchantress who was
to be his comfort and consolation, for the rest of his
respectable life.</p>

<p>Being somewhat disgusted with the result of his
visit to the witch with the romantic designation of
the “Mysterious Veiled Lady,” he had determined
to seek out one on this occasion with the most common-place
and every-day cognomen, in the whole
list. There being a Madame Widger in that delightful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
catalogue, of course Widger was the one selected.
It is true, she sometimes advertised herself as the
“Mysterious Spanish Lady,” but in the judgment of
the Individual, the Widger was too much for the
Spanish and the mystery.</p>

<p>So Madame Widger was resolved on. Her modest
advertisement is given, that the impartial reader
may be brought to acknowledge that the inducements
to wed the Widger were not of the common
order.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Madame Widger</span>, the Natural-Gifted Astrologist, Second-Sight
Seer and Doctress, tells past, present, and future events;
love, courtship, marriage, absent friends, sickness; prescribes
medicines for all diseases, property lost or stolen, at No. 3 First-av.,
near Houston-st.”</p></div>

<p>The slight lack of perspicuity in this announcement
seems to be a mysterious peculiarity, common
to all the Fortune Tellers, as if they were all imbued
with the same commendable contempt for all the
rules of English grammar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The voyager being attired in a captivating costume,
and being also provided with pencils and paper to
make a life-sketch, with a view to an expansive portrait
of his enslaver, whose beauty was with him a foregone
conclusion, set out with his faithful friend for the delightful
locality mentioned in the advertisement, where
the charming Circe, Widger, held her magic court.</p>

<p>He was not aware, at that time, that his intended
bride was not a blushing blooming maiden, but an
ancient dame, whose very wrinkles date back into
the eighteenth century. But of that hereafter.</p>

<p>He was determined to have her tell his “love,
courtship, or marriage, absent friends, or sickness,”
and to insist that she should “prescribe medicines
for property lost or stolen,” according to the exact
wording of the advertisement.</p>

<p>The doughty “Individual” trembled somewhat,
with an undefined sensation of awe, as though some
fearful ordeal was before him—to use his own elegant
and forcible language, he felt as though he was going
to encounter an earthquake with volcano trimmings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is the fluttering of new-born love in your manly
bosom,” remarked his companion.</p>

<p>“Well,” was the reply, “if a baby love kicks so
very like a horse of vicious propensities, a full-grown
Cupid would be so unmanageable as to defy the very
Rarey and all his works.”</p>

<p>Without any noteworthy adventure they kept on
their way to the First Avenue, and in due time stood,
awe-struck, before the mansion of the enchantress.</p>

<p>After the first impression had worn off, the scene
was somewhat stripped of its mysteriousness, and
assumed an aspect commonplace, not to say seedy.
As soon as the sense of bewilderment with which they
at first gazed upon the domicile of the mysterious
damsel so favored of the fates, had passed away, they
found themselves in a condition to make the observations
of the place and its surroundings that are
detailed below.</p>

<p>The house, a three-story brick, seemed to have that
architectural disease which is a perpetual epidemic
among the tenant-houses of the city, and which makes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
them look as if they had all been dipped in a strong
solution of something that had taken the skin off.
The paint was blistered and peeling off in flakes; the
blinds were hanging cornerwise by solitary hinges; the
shingles were starting from their places with a strange
air of disquietude, as if some mighty hand had stroked
them the wrong way; the door-steps were shaky and
crazy in the knees; the door itself had a curious air
of debility and emaciation, and the bell-knob was too
weak to return to its place after it had feebly done its
brazen duty. There was no door-plate, but on a battered
tin sign was blazoned, in fat letters, the mystic
word “Widger.” The Cash Customer rang the bell,
not once merely, or twice, but continuously, in pursuance
of a dogma which he laid down as follows:</p>

<p>“It is a mistake to ever stop ringing till somebody
comes. The feebler you ring, the more the servants
think you’re a dun, and therefore the more they don’t
come to let you in—but if you keep it up regularly
they’ll think you’re a rich relation and will rush to the
rescue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>”</p>

<p>So he kept on, and the voice of the bell sharply
clattered through the dismal old house, making as
much noise as if it suddenly wakened a thousand
echoes that had been locked up there for many years
without the power to speak till now. If a timid ring
denotes a dun, and a boisterous one a rich relation,
then must the inhabitants of that cleanly suburb have
been convinced that the present performer on the bell
not only had no claims as a creditor on the people of
the house, but was a rich California uncle, come to give
each adult member of that happy family a gold mine
or so, and to distribute a cart-load of diamonds among
the children.</p>

<p>The door at last was opened by an uncertain old
man with very weak eyes, who appeared to have, in
a milder form, the same malady which afflicted the
house; perhaps he was a twin, and suffered from brotherly
sympathy—at any rate the dilapidating disease
had touched him sorely; its ravages were particularly
noticeable in the toes of his boots and the elbows of
his coat. Violent remedies had evidently been applied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
in the latter case, but the patches were of different
colors, and suggestive of the rag-bag; the boots
were past hope of convalescence; his shirt-collar was
sunk under a greasy billow of a neckcloth, and only
one slender string was visible to show where it had
gone down; the nether garment was a ragged wreck,
that set a hundred tattered sails to every breeze, but
was anchored fast at the shoulder with a single disreputable
suspender.</p>

<p>Guided by this equivocal individual the two visitors
entered a small shabbily furnished room, and bestowed
themselves in a couple of treacherous chairs,
in pursuance of an imbecile invitation from the battered
old gentleman.</p>

<p>The anticipations of the enthusiastic lover again
began to fall, and in five minutes his heart, which so
lately was “burning with high hope,” was so cold as
to be uncomfortable.</p>

<p>On a seven-by-nine cooking-stove, which three pints
of coal would have driven blazing crazy, stood a
diminutive iron kettle, in which something was noisily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
stewing; the something may have been a decoction
of magic herbs, or it may have been Madame
Widger’s dinner. A tumble-down trunk in a corner
of the room did precarious duty for a chair; a faded
carpet hid the floor; a cheap rocking-chair in the act
of moulting its upholstery spread its luxurious arms
invitingly near the dim window; and a table, on
which a pack of German playing cards was coyly half
concealed by a newspaper, a coal-hod, and a poker,
completed the necessary furnishing of the apartment.</p>

<p>The ornaments are soon inventoried; a certificate
of membership of the New York State Agricultural
Society, given at Albany to Mr. M.&nbsp;G. Bivins, hung
in a cheap frame over the table. The other decorations
were a few prints of high-colored saints, an
engraving of a purple Virgin Mary with a pea-green
child, and a picture of a blue Joseph being sold by
yellow brethren to a crowd of scarlet merchants who
were paying for him with money that looked like
peppermint lozenges.</p>

<p>Madame Widger, the “Mysterious Spanish Lady,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>”
was not at first visible to the naked eye, but a loud,
shrill, vicious voice, which made itself heard through
the partition dividing the reception-room from some
apartment as yet unexplored by them, directed the
attention of her visitors to her exact locality.</p>

<p>She was “engaged” with another gentleman, said
the knight of the ragged inexpressibles.</p>

<p>Had not what he had already seen of the mansion
decidedly cooled the passion of the love-lorn customer,
this intelligence would have been likely to
rouse his ire against the interloping swain, and make
him pant for vengeance and fistic damages to the
other party; but in his present confused state of mind
he received this blow with philosophic indifference.</p>

<p>The old man subsided into a chair, and in a weak
sort of way began to talk, evidently with some insane
idea of pleasingly filling up the time until the prophetess
should be disengaged. His conversation
seemed to run to disasters, with a particular partiality
to shipwrecks. He accordingly detailed, with wonderful
exactness, the perils encountered by a certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
canal-boat of his, “loaded principally with butter and
cheese,” during a dangerous voyage from Albany to
New York, and which was finally brought safely to
a secure harbor by the power of the Widger, which
circumstance had made him her slave for life.</p>

<p>The shrill voice then ceased, and the person to
whom it had been addressed came forth. The lime
on his blue jean garments, and the cloudy appearance
of his boots, declared him to be something in the
mason line. He deported himself with becoming
reverence, and departed in apparent awe. He did not
look like a dangerous rival, and he was not molested.</p>

<p>A discreditable and disordered head now thrust
itself out of the mysterious closet, opened its mouth,
and the vicious voice said: “I will see you now, sir.”
The sighing swain, with a fluttering heart and
unsteady steps, summoned his courage and entered
the place, to him as mysterious as was Bluebeard’s
golden-keyed closet to his ninth wife. The first
glance at Madame Widger at once scattered again all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
his dreams of love and of happiness with that potent
and fearful female.</p>

<p>He encountered a cadaverous bony-looking woman,
very tall, very old, though with hair still black; with
grey eyes, and false gleaming teeth. She was attired
in calico; quality, ten cents a yard; appearance,
dirty. Hardly was the door closed, when the vicious
voice spitefully remarked, “Sit down, sir;” and a
skinny finger pointed to a cane-bottomed chair.
While seating himself and taking off his gloves, he
took an observation.</p>

<p>The apartment was not large; in an unfurnished
state, a moderately-hooped belle might have stood in
it without serious damage to her outskirts, but there
would be little extra room for any enterprising
adventurer to circumnavigate her. In one corner
was a small pine light-stand, on which was a sceptical
looking Bible, with a very black brass key tied in it;
a volume of Cowper bound in full calf; a little lamp
with a single lighted wick, and a pile of the Madame’s
business hand-bills.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>She at once showed her experience of human nature
and her distrust of her present visitor by her practical
and matter-of-fact conduct.</p>

<p>She sat uncomfortably down on the very edge of
an angular chair, folded her hands, shut herself half
up like a jack-knife, and the vicious voice mentioned
this fearful fact: “My terms are a dollar for gentlemen;”
and the grey eyes stonily stared until the
dollar aforesaid was produced.</p>

<p>The voice then prepared for business by sundry
“Ahems!” and when fairly in working order
it proceeded: “Give me your hand—your <i>left</i>
hand.”</p>

<p>The Widger took the extended palm in her shrivelled
fingers and made four rapid dabs in the middle of
it with the forefinger of her other hand, as if she were
scornfully pointing out defects in its workmanship;
then she opened the drawer of the little stand with a
spiteful jerk, and withdrew thence something which
she put to her sinister optic, and began rapidly screwing
it round with both hands, as if she had got water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
on the brain and was trying to tap herself in
the eye.</p>

<p>Then the vicious voice began, in a loud mechanical
manner, to speak with the greatest volubility, running
the sentences together, and not thinking of a comma
or a period till her breath was exhausted, in a manner
that would have fairly distanced Susan Nipper
herself, even if that rapid young lady had twenty
seconds the start.</p>

<p>“I see by looking in this stone that you was born
under two planets one is the planet Mars you will die
under the planet Jupiter but it won’t be this year or
next you have seen a great deal of trouble and misfortune
in your past life but better days are surely in store
for you you have passed through many things which
if written in a book would make a most interesting
volume I see by looking more closely in the stone that
you are about to receive two letters one a business
letter the other a let—”</p>

<p>Here her breath failed, and as soon as it came back
the voice continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>—</p>

<p>“ter from a friend it is written very closely and
is crossed I see by looking more closely in the stone
that one of the letters will contain news which will
distress you exceedingly for a little while but you
need not be troubled for it will all be for your good
you are soon to have an interview with a man of
light hair and blue eyes who will profess great
interest in you but he will get the advantage of you
if he can you must beware of him I see by looking
more closely in the stone that you will live to be
68 years old but you will die before you are 70.”
Here was another station where the locomotive voice
stopped to take in air, and then instantly dashed
ahead at a greater speed than ever. “I see by
looking more closely in the stone that good luck
will befall you a near friend will die and leave you
a fortune I see by looking more closely in the
stone that this will happen to you when you are
between 32 and 34 years old that is all I see in this
stone.”</p>

<p>Another grab brought from the little drawer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
another pebble, which the Madame placed at her
eye, the boring operation was recommenced, and
the vicious voice once more got up steam.</p>

<p>“I see by looking closely in this stone that you will
have two wives one will be blue-eyed and the other
will be black-eyed with the first one you will not live
long but with the last one you will be happy many
years I see by looking more closely in the stone that
you will have six children which will be very comfortable
the lady who is to be your first wife is at
this moment thinking of you I see by looking more
closely in the stone that a man with light hair and
blue eyes is trying to get her away from you but she
scorns him and turns away I see by looking more
closely in the stone that she has a strong feeling for
you you need not fear the man with light hair and
blue eyes for you will get her you and you only will
possess her heart I see by looking more closely in the
stone that she is good gentle kind loving affectionate
true-hearted and pleasant.”</p>

<p>(The vicious voice resented each one of these good-natured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
adjectives, as if it had been a gross personal
insult to the Widger, and spit them spitefully at her
trembling customer, as if they tasted badly in her
mouth.)</p>

<p>“and will make you a good wife; you will be rich
and happy you will be successful in business you
will be hereafter always lucky you will be distinguished
you will be eminent you will be good you
will be respected you will be beloved honored cherished
and will reach a good old age I see by looking
in this stone—that is all I see by looking in this
stone.”</p>

<p>Here she ceased, and choking down her indignation,
which had risen to a fearful pitch during
the complimentary peroration, she said, taking
up the equivocal Bible with the key tied in it,
“Take hold of the key with your finger, I will
give you one wish, if the book turns round you
will have your wish.” The guest took the key in
the required manner, and the Widger closed her eyes
and muttered something which may have been either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
a prayer or a recipe for pickling red cabbage, for he
was unable to satisfy himself with any degree of
certainty what it was; at the appointed time the
book turned and the wish was therefore graciously
granted.</p>

<p>Her hearer smiled his grimmest smile, and ventured
to inquire if his unknown rival was making any progress
in securing the affections of the lady in dispute,
and received the satisfying answer, “She scorns him
and turns away.” Reassured by this, the susceptible
individual mentally and fiercely defied the blue-eyed
intruder to do his worst, and with a reverential obeisance
left the presence. As he departed, the skinny
hand presented him with a handbill, but the vicious
voice was silent.</p>

<p>Carefully conning the handbill as they slowly
departed from the august realm of the Madame, the
seekers of magic for the lowest cash price read the
following particulars:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Madame Widger was born with this wonderful gift of
revealing the destinies of man, and she has revealed mysteries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
that no mortal knew. She states that she advertises nothing
but what she can do with entire satisfaction to all who wish to
consult her.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Also, she will scan aright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreams and visions of the night.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The tender inquirer went away in a desponding
mood. The Widger was out of the question as a
bride, “for she was old enough,” he said, “to have
been grandmother to his father’s uncle.”</p>

communicated to her Cash Customer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></h3>



<h2>CHAPTER V.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></h2>

<hr />

<h3>MRS. PUGH, No. 102 SOUTH FIRST STREET,
WILLIAMSBURGH.</h3>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">It</span> is travelling a little away from home to go to
Williamsburgh in search of a witch, but there are
some peculiar circumstances about the present case,
that give it more than common interest. Mrs. Pugh
is not an <i>advertising</i> sorceress, but practises all her
magic slily, and generally under a promise of secresy,
which is exacted lest the fame of her fortune-telling
should come to the ears of certain respectable
families, who employ her as a nurse. She is much
resorted to by a number of young persons of both
sexes, and has considerable notoriety among the low
and ignorant classes as a practiser of the black art.
She is by no means the only “nurse” who is given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to this reprehensible practice, but very many of the
old women who officiate as professional nurses are
proficients in telling fortunes with cards, and with
the Bible and key, and are always glad of an opportunity
to exhibit their pretended skill. Being at
times received into families where there are daughters,
not grown up, they become most dangerous
persons if they are encouraged or permitted to
thus practise on the credulity of these young
girls.</p>

<p>The mere encouragement of hurtful superstitious
notions is a great ill in itself, but is by no means the
extent of the evil done by some of these persons.
They not unfrequently take an active part in bringing
about meetings between unsuspecting girls and evil-disposed
men, thus paving the way to the wretchedness
and ruin of the former. More than one instance
is known, where the going astray of a loved daughter
can be traced directly to the mischievous teachings
of a fortune-telling nurse.</p>

<p>These are the reasons that give the case of Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Pugh an importance greater than attaches to many
others.</p>

<p>It is right that people should know that a certain
degree of circumspection ought to be used, with
regard to moral character, as well as other qualifications,
in the selection of a nurse, lest a person
be employed who will work irreparable mischief
among the younger members of the family.</p>


<h4>The Individual calls on a Nursing Sorceress.</h4>

<p>Who shall say that broomstick locomotion is a
lost art, and that steam has superseded magic in the
matter of travelling? Because no one of us has ever
encountered a witch on her basswood steed, shall we
presume to assert that witches no longer bestride basswood
steeds and make their nocturnal excursions to
blasted heaths, there to meet the devil in the social
midnight orgie, and kick up their withered heels in
the gay diabolical dance with other ancient females
of like kidney with themselves? Because no one of
us has ever beheld with his own personal optics, an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
old woman change herself into a black cat, shall we
therefore assert that the ancient dames of our own
day are unable to accomplish that feline transformation?
“Not by no manner of means whatsomdever,”
as Mr. Weller would remark.</p>

<p>Let us not then be found without charity for the
peculiar and persistent faith of the hero of this book,
who, though thrice bitterly disappointed in his matrimonial
speculations among the witches, still clung
to the fond belief that a bride with supernatural
powers of doing things would be a splendid speculation,
and that such a spouse could be found if he, her
ardent lover, did not give up the chase too soon.
Spite of his disappointment with Madame Bruce, and
his crushing discomfiture with Madame Widger,
Hope still sprang eternal in the “Individual’s”
breast, and he felt, like the immortal Mr. Brown
of classic verse, that it would “never do to give it
up so.”</p>

<p>He had something of a natural turn for mechanics,
and having been of late engaged in some entertaining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
speculations on steam engines, he came not unnaturally
to think of the wonderful advantage the magically-endowed
people of old had over the present age
in the matter of locomotion. He thought of that
wonderful carpet on which a jolly little party had but
to seat themselves and wish to be transported to any
far-off spot, and presto! change! there they were
instanter. No collisions to be feared; no running
off the track at a speed of ever-so-many unaccountable
miles an hour; no cast-iron-voiced conductor at
short intervals demanding tickets; no old women
with sour babies; no obtrusive boys with double-priced
books and magazines; no other boys with
peanuts, apples, and pop-corn; nothing, in fact, save
one’s own social circle but a civil genie, not of Irish
extraction, to fly alongside to mix the juleps and
carry the morning paper.</p>

<p>It was very natural to consider whether there
wasn’t a yard or two left somewhere of that valuable
carpet, and to regret that on the whole probably the
original owners had occasion to use the entire piece.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the thought was very naturally suggested of
the marvellous wooden horse with the pegs in his
neck, who soared with his riders a great deal higher
than does Mr. Wise in his clumsy balloon, and
always came down a great deal easier than ever
Mr. Wise did yet. Of course the Cash Customer was
from the start perfectly convinced that <i>that</i> breed of
horses is long since extinct, so long ago that no
record of them is now to be found in either the
“American Racing Calendar,” or the “English Stud
Book.”</p>

<p>Then very naturally came thoughts of the broomstick
changes of the more modern witches. Perhaps,
he thought, these are the colts of the wooden horse,
degenerate, it is true, and lacking in the grace and
symmetry of their extraordinary sire, but still perhaps
not inferior in speed or in safety of carriage.</p>

<p>The thought was a brilliant one, and it was really
worth while to inquire into the matter and pursue
this phantom steed until he was fairly hunted down
and bridled ready for use.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>It needed no long cogitation or extended argument
to convince Johannes, the “Individual,” the Cash
Customer, of the immense practical value of such a
steed, to say nothing of his costing nothing to keep,
and of its therefore being utterly impossible for him
to “eat his own head off,” and of his never growing
old, and of his never having any of the multitudinous
diseases that afflict ordinary horses without any intermixture
of magic blood, and therefore of it being out
of the question for anybody to cheat his owner in a
horse-trade.</p>

<p>Why, only think of his value for livery purposes
in case his happy proprietor was disposed to let
other folks use him for a proper compensation. He
could of course be trained to carry double, and no
doubt Mr. Rarey, or some other person potent in
horse education, could easily break him to go in
harness.</p>

<p>It wasn’t likely, Johannes cogitated, that the
judges would allow him to enter his ligneous racer
at the Fashion Course, so that he’d not get a chance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to win any money from Lancet and Flora Temple,
still there was a hope, even on that point.</p>

<p>So, in search of the witch wife, whose dower
should be the broomstick horse, that should set the
fond couple up in business, started the sanguine
lover.</p>

<p>Having had some experience of New York fortune-tellers
and others in the magic line, and not
thinking they were of the sort likely to have so
great a treasure, he started for the suburbs, and
crossed the ferry to Williamsburgh, in order to pay a
visit of inquiry, and if possible to take the initiatory
step in courting Mrs. Pugh, of No. 102 South First
Street, in that city.</p>

<p>He designed, of course, to buy a “fortune” at a
liberal price, for the purpose of setting the lady in
good-humor as a necessary preliminary step. He
really had hopes that she would prove to be of a
slightly different style from some of the New York
fortune-tellers, who seem to have mistaken their
profession and to be hardly up to reading the stars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
with success, although they might be fully equal to
all the financial exigencies of an apple and peanut
stand, or might win an honorable distinction crying
“radishes and lettuce” in the early morning hours;
or upon trial, might, perhaps, evince a decided genius
for the rag-picking business, or preside over the fortunes
of a soap-fat cart with distinguished ability.</p>

<p>Threading the winding ways of Williamsburgh is
by no means an easy task for one unaccustomed, and
it was only by incessantly stopping the passers-by and
making the most minute inquiries that this lady was
ever achieved at all.</p>

<p>This constant questioning of the public revealed,
however, the fact that Mrs. Pugh does not by any
means depend upon her fortune-telling for her bread-and-butter;
she is a nurse, as many a Williamsburgh
baby could testify if it could command its emotions
long enough to speak. What will be the influence
of her supernaturalism and witchcraft upon the children
intrusted to her fostering care—whether they
will in after life prove to be devils, demi-gods, heroes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
or mere ordinary “humans,” time alone can show.
This illustrious lady does not advertise in the newspapers;
in fact, her fortune-telling is done on the sly,
as if she were yet an apprentice, and a little ashamed
of her bungling jobs, for which, by the way, she only
charges half price. She is in a very undecided state,
and evidently undetermined whether her proper
vocation is tending babies or revealing the decrees
of the fates at twenty-five cents a head, and when
her visitors made their appearance she was puzzled to
know whether their business was baby or black art.</p>

<p>Her exertions in either profession have not as yet
gained her a very large fortune, judging from the
surroundings of her eligible residence.</p>

<p>The domicile of this chrysalis enchantress is a low
frame house of two stories, standing back from the
street, directly in the rear of another row of more
pretentious mansions, as if it had been sent into the
back yard in disgrace and never permitted to show
itself in good society again. It seems conscious of
its humiliation, and wears an air of architectural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
dejection that is quite touching. A troop of dirty-faced
children was in the yard, and in the corner
was a pile of other household incumbrances, consisting
principally of mops and washtubs.</p>

<p>Johannes critically examined this interesting collection,
but the wished-for broomstick was not there.
A modest rap brought to the door a large ill-favored
man with a red nose and a ponderous pair of boots,
whose speciality seemed to be drinking whatever
spirituous liquors were consumed about the establishment.</p>

<p>Having passed this shirt-sleeved sentinel without
damage, though not without fear, the Cash Customer
sat down to take an observation.</p>

<p>The wooden courser was not to be seen at first
glance. The room was a small irregularly-shaped
one, with an intrusive chimney jutting out into the
floor from one side, as if it were a sturdy brick-and-mortar
poor relation of the premises come a visiting
and not to be got rid of at any price. A small cooking-stove
was in the fireplace, with an attendant on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
either side in the shape of a battered coal-scuttle, and
a small saucepan full of charcoal; the floor was covered
with a dirty rag carpet that had long since outlived
its beauty and its usefulness, and was now in
the last extremity of a tattered old age; half-a-dozen
chairs of different patterns, all much shattered in
health and enfeebled by long years of labor, and a
decrepit lounge in the last stages of a decline, were
the seats reserved for visitors; the other furniture of
the room was an antique chest of drawers of a most
curious and complicated pattern—it seemed as if the
mechanic had been uncertain whether he was to construct
a bureau or a cow-shed, and had accordingly
satisfied his conscience by making half-a-dozen
drawers and building a sloping roof over them; the
joints were warped apart, and through the chinks
could be seen fragments of clean shirt, and ends of
lace, and bits of flannel, suggesting babies. At a
wink from the female, the male with the ponderous
boots retired from the presence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pugh is a woman of medium height and size,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
with a clear grey eye, and light hair, and wearing
that sycophantic smile peculiar to people who have
much to do with ugly babies whose beauty must be
constantly praised to the doting parents. She was
attired in a neat calico dress, constructed for family
use, and for the particular accommodation of the
younger members of the household.</p>

<p>Johannes, who had been taking a sly look, had
made up his mind that she would not be quite so
objectionable for a wife as he had feared, and he had
fully resolved to woo and wed her off-hand, provided
she had the broomstick of his hopes.</p>

<p>So, by way of a beginning, he announced that he
would like her to exercise her magic powers in his
behalf.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pugh had evidently previously regarded him
as an enthusiastic young father with a pair of troublesome
twins, who had come to seek her ministrations,
and she undoubtedly had high wages, innumerable
presents, and exorbitant perquisites in her mind’s eye
at that instant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>When, however, she learned that her visitor merely
wished to know what the fates had resolved to do
about his particular case, she was slightly disappointed,
for the babies are more profitable than the planets.
However, she soon reconciled herself to her fate, and
produced from some cranny immediately under the
eaves of the cow-shed bureau, a pack of cards
wrapped up in an old newspaper. She then carefully
locked the door to keep out the children, and drew
down the curtains lest their inquiring minds should
lead them to observe her mysterious operations
through the window. Then taking the wonder-working
pieces of pasteboard in her hands, and seating
herself opposite her visitor, she announced her
gracious will, thus: “You shall have six wishes.”</p>

<p>Then, without asking him what he wished for, or
whether he wished for anything, she shuffled the
cards a few seconds, and read off their mysterious
significance as follows, her curious and anxious customer
looking furtively around, meanwhile, to spy
out the hiding-place of the wooden courser:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Pears to me you will have good luck in futur,
though it seems to me that you have had a great deal
of bad luck and misfortune in your life; but you will
certainly do better in your futur days than you have
done yet in your life, at least, so it seems to me.
’Pears to me your good luck will commence right
away, pretty soon, immediate, in a very few days;
you will have some great good luck befal you within
a 9. I designate time by days, and weeks, and months,
and sometimes years, so this good luck of which I
told you, you will certainly have within 9 days, or
9 weeks, or 9 months, or possibly 9 years—9 days I
think; yes, I am sure; within 9 days, at least so it
’pears to me. You are going to make a change in
your business, so it seems to me—you are going to
leave your present business, and make a change;
you will make this change within a 7, which may be
7 days or weeks; weeks I think, yes certainly within
7 weeks, at least so it ’pears to me—this change in
your business which will take place in 7 days, or
weeks, I think, yes weeks I’m sure, will be a change<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
for the better, and you will profit by it much, at least
so it seems to me—and it will come to pass within a
7; as I said before, within a 7, months or days it may
be, but weeks I think; yes, now I look again, within
a 7, weeks I’m certain, at least, so it ’pears to me—you
will receive a letter within a 3; years, perhaps,
months, it may be, but still it looks like days; yes,
days I’m sure, days it must be; within a 3, and days
they are; you will receive a letter within 3 days, I’m
positively sure, or so it ’pears to me. You have
friends across water, from whom you will hear
speedily and soon, within a 5, which may be months,
although I think not, for it looks like years; did I
say years? no, days; yes, days it is again; within a
5, and days they are; this letter you will have within
5 days; it will contain excellent news, which will
please you much; money, the news will be, and you
will get the letter within a 5, which may be months
or years, but days it looks like, and first-rate news it
is, of money; I am positively certain that it is within
a 5, at least it seems so to me. You face up good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
luck and prosperity, and you will be very rich before
you die, though I do not see how you are to get your
money, whether by business or legacy; but you will
be very rich, or so it seems to me. You will receive
some money within a 4; it will be in three parcels,
and there will be considerable of it. You will get
it in three parcels within a 4, not hours, nor years,
nor yet months, but weeks; money in three parcels
within a 4, and weeks they are, I’m certain. The
money will be in three parcels—three parcels; in
three parcels you will get money within a 4, which,
now I look again, it may be years, but still I think
not. No, it is weeks; I’m certain, at least, so it
’pears to me. There is a lady that has a good heart
for you. She is a light-complexioned lady, with
black eyes; she has a good heart for you, and I do
not see any trouble between you, which means that
there is no opposition to your match, and that you
will certainly marry her within a 2, at least so it
’pears to me. Within a 2 you will marry this light-complexioned
lady, within a 2, which is not hours,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
nor yet days, I think it is months. I’ll look again;
no, it is not months, but years; within a 2 and years
they are, yes, 2 years; before a 2, and years they are,
this lady will be your wife—at least, so it seems to
me. ’Pears to me you will get money with her, I do
not know how much, but you will certainly get
money in three parcels, as I once remarked before,
within a 4, which I’m sure is weeks. You will be
married twice; once within a 2, once again within a
5 or 7 after your first wife dies. I think it is a 5,
though it may be a 7; and months it looks like,
though it may be weeks or days. You will live with
your first wife a 10; days it can’t be, though it looks
like days—a 10, you’ll live with her a 10, can it be
hours, no, years it is, it must be, because you will
have five children by your first wife, which makes
it years—10 years it is, I know, at least so it ’pears
to me. You will have five children by your first
wife, but you will not raise them all. All will die
but two, and then your wife will die within a 1,
which is a month, or so it seems to me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>”</p>

<p>The inquirer was charmed with the lively prospect
of so many funerals, and mentally resolved to buy
a couple of acres in Greenwood for the accommodation
of his future family. His meditations were
interrupted by the lady, who thus continued:</p>

<p>“You will marry a second wife, but you will
have trouble about her; there is a dark-complexioned
man who interferes, and who will trouble you
for an 8, which may be years, although I think not,
nor hours, nor days, but months; I’m sure it is—yes,
the dark-complexioned man will trouble you
for an 8, which I am sure is months, yes, months
it is, an 8 I say, and months they are, I am certain,
at least so it ’pears to me. By your second wife
you will have three children, who will all live—I
see a funeral here within a 6; it does not look like
a friend or a relative, but it is some acquaintance,
or the friend of some acquaintance, or the acquaintance
of some friend—the funeral is within a 6, but
it does not come very near to you—you will go to
a wedding within a 3, and you will receive a present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of a ring within a 2, which may be days—you will
after this be very prosperous and happy, you will
be very long-lived—you will get a letter and a
present from the light-complexioned lady within a
9, which, as I said before, it may be hours, which
I think it is, though weeks it may be, or months,
or even years; though certainly within a 9, which,
now I look again, is days, yes, I am sure, certain,
within a 9, a letter and a present from the light-complexioned
lady, a 9 it is and days, within a 9,
and days they are, at least, so it ’pears to me.”</p>

<p>Here ended the communication, and, on inquiring
the price, Johannes was astonished to learn that he
had received but twenty-five cents’ worth. Regretting
that he had not invested a dollar in a commodity
so “cheap and very filling at the price”
for future consumption, he departed, first taking a
long lingering look to find, if possible, the lurking-place
of the magic broomstick charger. He didn’t
see it, and gave it up, and came away declaring
that such a woman was not qualified to take the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
social position his wife must assume. He did not,
however, wish to discourage her; he thought that
the water-melon trade might be comprehended by a
lady of her abilities, or that she could perhaps thoroughly
master the pop-corn and molasses candy
business, and make it lucrative.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<hr />

<h3>MADAME MORROW, THE ASTONISHER, No. 76
BROOME STREET.</h3>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Madame Morrow</span> is the only one of the fortune-telling
fraternity in New York who refuses to
dispense her astrological favors to both sexes. She
positively declines receiving any visits from “gentlemen,”
and confines her business attention exclusively
to “ladies,” of whom many are her regular
customers. One reason for this course of conduct
is, that she imagines her own sex to be the more
credulous, and more readily disposed to put faith
in her claims to supernatural knowledge, and she
naturally prefers to deal with believers rather than
with sceptics. Her “lady” customers are more
tractable and easily managed than men, and are not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
so apt to ask puzzling and impertinent questions;
and as the Madame can manage more of them in
a day, of course the pecuniary return is larger than
if she exercised her art in behalf of curious masculinity
as well.</p>

<p>Of her history before she engaged in her present
business, not much is known to those who have
met her only of late years, for with regard to her
early life she chooses to exercise a politic reticence.
The whole “style” of the woman, however, her
dress, manner, and conversation, are strong indications
that her younger and more attractive days
were not passed in a nunnery, but more probably
in establishments where “Free Love” is more than
a theory. The character of the greater part of her
“lady” visitors is of a grade that goes to corroborate
this supposition, and leads to the belief that
among women of doubtful virtue “old acquaintance”
is not easily “forgot.” By far the greater number of
Madame Morrow’s customers are girls of the town,
and women of even more disreputable character.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact that a visit to this renowned sorceress
must be paid in a feminine disguise, made the
attempt to secure an interview of more than ordinary
interest. How this difficulty was mastered, and how
an entrance was finally effected into the citadel
from which all mankind is rigorously excluded, is
best told in the words of the “Individual” who
accomplished that curious feat.</p>


<h4>How the Cash Customer visited the “Astonisher”—How
he was Astonished—and How he saw his Future Husband.</h4>

<p>The Cash Customer in pursuit of a wife had been
rebuffed, but was not disheartened. He had, so to
speak, fought a number of very severe hymeneal
rounds and got the worst of them all; but he had
taken his punishment like a man, and had still
wind and pluck to come up bravely to the matrimonial
scratch when “time” was called, and as
yet showed no signs of giving in. His backers, if
he’d had any, would have still been tolerably sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of their money, and not painfully anxious to hedge.
The bets would have been about even that he’d
win the fight yet, and come out of the battle a
triumphant husband, instead of being knocked out
of the field a disconsolate and discomfited bachelor.</p>

<p>But, although his ardor had not cooled, and
though his strength and determination still held
out, he had grown slightly cautious, and had conceived
a plan for going like a spy into the camp
of the enemy, and there thoroughly reconnoitring
the positions that he had to storm, and at the same
time making himself master of the wiles and stratagems
that were the peculiar weapons of the female
foe, and so learn some infallible way to capture a
first-quality wife. At any rate, he would give
himself the benefit of the doubt and make the
experiment. He would a-wooing go, not apparelled
in conquering broadcloth, in subjugating marseilles,
or overpowering doeskin, but carrying the unaccustomed,
but not less potent weapons of laces, moire-antique,
crinoline, and gaiters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>In fact, there was also a stern necessity in the case,
for the lady on whom he had now set his young
affections was particular as to her customers, and did
not admit the shirt-collar gender to the honor of
her confidence.</p>

<p>But was this to stop him? If the lady shut out
the whole masculine world from the inevitable
fascinations of her superabundant charms, was it
not for sweet charity’s sake, that a whole community
might not go into ecstatic frenzies over her peerless
beauty, and all men, being stricken in love of the
same woman, go to cutting each other’s throats
with bowie-knives and other modern improvements!</p>

<p>It was easy to see that <i>Madame Morrow</i> did not
want to become another Helen, to be abducted to
some modern Troy, and have a ten years’ row, and
any quantity of habeas corpuses, and innumerable
contempts of interminable courts, after the modern
fashion of conducting a strife about a runaway
maiden.</p>

<p>Such a considerate beauty, veiling her undoubted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
fascinations from the rude gaze of man, from purely
prudential reasons, must be a prize of rare value,
and well worth the winning.</p>

<p>Her qualifications in magic, too, seemed to be of
the very first order, to judge from her notification to
the wonder-seeking world.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Astonishing to All.</span>—Madame <span class="smcap">Morrow</span> claims to be the
most wonderful astrologist in the world, or that has ever been
known, as I am the seventh daughter of the seventh daughter,
who was also a great astrologist. I have a natural gift to
tell past, present, and future events of life. I have astonished
thousands during my travels in Europe. I will tell how many
times you are to be married, how soon, and will show you
the likeness of your future husband, and will cause you to
be speedily married, and you will enjoy the greatest happiness
of matrimonial bliss and good luck through your whole life. I
will also show the likeness of absent friends and relations, and I
will tell so true all the concerns of life that you cannot help
being astonished. No charge, if not satisfied. Gentlemen not
admitted. No. 76 Broome street, near Columbia.”</p></div>

<p>There was but one thing in this that troubled the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
“Individual” with any particularly sharp pangs. He
intended to marry the Astonisher, but he was a
little bothered what to do with the seven daughters,
for of course the Madame would not fail to follow
the excellent example of her revered mother, and
would never stop short of the mystic number.</p>

<p>He finally concluded that all his duties as a father
would be faithfully performed if he taught them to
read, write, and play on the piano, and then gave
them each a sewing-machine to begin the world with.
He did think of bringing them up for the ballet, but
their success in that profession being somewhat dependent
on the size and symmetry of their dancing
implements, he felt it would be improper to positively
determine on that line of business before he had been
favored with a sight of the young ladies. Reserving,
therefore, his decision on this knotty point until time
should further develop the subject, he prepared for
the unsexing which was indicated as an inevitable
preliminary to a visit to Madame Morrow, by the
sentence “Gentlemen not admitted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>”</p>

<p>He proposed to get himself up in a way that would
slightly astonish the Madame herself, although she
had faithfully promised in her advertisement to astonish
him. He would have been willing to wager a
small sum that with all her witchcraft she would be
unable to keep that promise, for in the regular course
of his business, he had become so accustomed to marvels,
wonders, and miracles, that the upheaval of a
volcano in the Park wouldn’t discompose him unless
it singed his whiskers. He had a strong desire, however,
to realize the old sensation of astonishment, and
he was of the opinion that the “likeness of his future
husband” would accomplish that feat if anything
could.</p>

<p>Heroic was Johannes, and withal ingenious, and
this then was his wonderful plan.</p>

<p>He would visit this Madame Morrow, not by proxy,
but in his own proper person; if not as a man, then
as a woman; yes, he would petticoat himself up to the
required dimensions, if it took a week to tie on the
machinery. Off with the pantaloons; on with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
skirts; down with the broadcloth; hurrah for the cotton
and hey for victory, and a look at his future husband.</p>

<p>To an inventor of theatrical costumes hied he
with this fell design in his heart.</p>

<p>The requisite paraphernalia were bargained for and
sent home to the ambitious voyager, who, at the sight
thereof, was “astonished” in advance, and stricken
aghast by the complicated mysteries of laces, ribbons,
strings, bones, buttons, pins, capes, collars, and other
inexplicable articles that met his gaze.</p>

<p>The question instantly occurred, “Could he get
into these things?”</p>

<p>Not a bit of it; he would sooner undertake to report
in short-hand the speech of a thunder-cloud,
and with much better prospects of success. He felt
his own insignificance, and as he looked out at the
window, he regarded a passing female with awe. He
felt that he was fast becoming imbecile, not to say
idiotic, when he bethought him of his friends. Two
discreet married men, who knew the ropes, were
called to the rescue, and began the work; they piled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
on layer after layer of the material, and in the course
of four or five hours had built him into a pyramid
of the proper size, when they gave him their solemn
assurance that he was “all right.” He has since discovered
that they had tied his under-sleeves round his
ankles, and that the things he wore on his arms must
have belonged somewhere else. There was trouble
about the hair, and it required the combined ingenuity
and wisdom of the masculine trio to keep the
bonnet on, and this difficulty was only overcome at
last by tying strings from the inside of the crown of
that invention to the ears of the sufferer.</p>

<p>Then, and not till then, had anybody thought
of the whiskers. They must be sacrificed; and
though the miserable victim to his own ambition
consented to the disfigurement, how was it to be
accomplished? The luckless Johannes could no
more sit down in a barber’s chair than the City
Hall could get into an omnibus. At last he knelt
down, which was the nearest approach he could
make to a sitting position, and Jenkins, mounted on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the bed, shaved him as well as he could at arm’s
length.</p>

<p>When the operation was concluded, his head
looked as if it had been parboiled and the skin
taken off. He didn’t dare to curse Jenkins for
his clumsiness, knowing that if he relieved his mind
in that desirable manner, Jenkins would refuse to
help him undress when he wanted to get out of the
innumerable manacles that now confined every joint.
He was as helpless as a turtle that the unkind hand
of ruthless man has rolled over on his back.</p>

<p>However, the disguise was complete; he looked in
the glass and thought he was his own landlady; his
best friends wouldn’t have known him, and the
teller of the bank would have pronounced him a
forgery and refused to certify him; he felt like a
full-rigged clipper ship, and got under sail as soon
as possible and bore down upon Madame Morrow’s
residence. He nearly capsized as he stepped into
the street, but he righted after a heavy lurch to the
north-east, and kept his course without further serious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
disaster. He made a speedy run to Broome street,
the voyage being accomplished in less than the
expected time, although a heavy sea, in the shape
of a boy with a wheelbarrow, struck him amidships,
on the corner of Sheriff street, doing some damage
to his lower works and carrying away a yard or
so of lace from his main skirt. He finally came
up to the house in splendid style, and cast anchor
on the opposite sidewalk to take an observation.</p>

<p>The anchorage was good, and he rode securely for
a short time until he could repair damages, he having
carried away some of his upper rigging; in other
words, he had caught his veil on a meat-hook and had
been unable to rescue it. He rigged a sort of jury-veil
with the end of his shawl, so that he could hide
his blushing countenance in case of too close scrutiny.</p>

<p>Madame Morrow lives, as he now discovered, in a
low, three-story brick house, which cannot be called
dirty, simply because that mild word expresses an
approximation towards cleanliness which no house in
this locality has known for years. City readers can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
get an idea of its condition by understanding that it
is in the worst part of “The Hook;” to readers in
the country, who have luckily never seen anything
filthier than a barn yard, no information can be
given which would meet the case. Sunshine is the
only protection for a well-dressed man against the
population of this part of the town. In the twilight
or darkness he would be robbed, if not garroted and
murdered. The boldest and most desperate burglars,
and others of that stamp, have their homes about
here—fathers who teach their children the thief’s
profession, and mothers who carry pickpockets at the
breast. In the midst of this nest of crime the
fortune-teller has her home, and here she thrives.</p>

<p>The daring man, protected by his false colors,
there being no officious authority in that neighborhood
to exercise the right of search, came alongside
the house and prepared, metaphorically, to board;
that is, he rang the bell.</p>

<p>He was admitted by an Irish girl, whose incrusted
face showed that the same deposit of dirt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
had probably held possession undisturbed for weeks.
They had just entered the hall door when two
small children, who were contending for their
vested rights with a big yellow dog that had
interfered with their dinner, commenced an unearthly
squalling, which, for the instant, made the
millinery delegate fairly believe that Tophet was
out for noon. The Hibernian maiden, with great
presence of mind, immediately attempted to quiet
the storm by administering to each inverted brat
a sound correction, in the manner usually adopted
by mothers.</p>

<p>Particulars are omitted.</p>

<p>Then she resumed her attentions to the stranger,
and convoyed him into port in the parlor. Securely
harbored in this safe retreat, Johannes took another
observation.</p>

<p>The room was small, and what few things were
in it looked shabby and dirty of course. The principal
article of furniture was a huge basketful of
soiled linen, which had probably been “taken in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>”
to wash, and from a respectable family, for every
single article looked ashamed to be caught in such
company, and tried to burrow down out of sight.
Disconsolate shirts elbowed humiliated socks, which
in turn kicked against mortified flannels, or hid
themselves beneath disconcerted sheets; abashed
shirt-collars and humbled dickies tried to shrink out
of sight in very shame beneath a dishonored tablecloth,
the wine-stains on which showed it to belong in
better society. A dejected and cast-down woman
was assorting the despairing contents of the basket
with a look of desolation.</p>

<p>The girl, who had disappeared, now returned, and
with an air of mystery slipped into the hand of her
visitor a red card, on which was inscribed:</p>

<div class="bbox" style="width: 20em"><p>No Person allowed to remain in the Establishment
without a ticket. Please present this on
entering Madame Morrow’s room. Fee in full, $1.</p></div>

<p>For an hour and a half after the receipt of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
card and the payment of $1 therefor, did Johannes
quietly wait in the room with the big basket, being
entertained meanwhile by the two women who conversed
with each other upon the relative merits of
engines No. 18 and 27, and with a long discussion as
to the comparative personal beauty of “Tom” and
“Dick,” who, it seemed, belonged respectively to
those two mechanical constituents of our Fire Department.</p>

<p>At the end of that time the Irish girl, who had
succeeded in establishing “Dick’s” claim to her
satisfaction, arose and invited the stranger to the
room of Madame Morrow.</p>

<p>He passed up a narrow flight of stairs, the condition
of which, as to dirt, was concealed by no friendly
carpet; then he sailed into a front parlor which was
furnished elegantly, and perhaps gorgeously, with
carpets, mirrors, sofas, and all the usual requirements
of a lady’s apartment.</p>

<p>Madame herself appeared at the door. She is a
tall, sallow-looking woman, with a complexion the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
color of old parchment: with light brown eyes and
light hair; being attired in a handsome delaine dress
of half-mourning, and decorated with a costly cameo
pin and ear-drops, she looked not unlike a servant
out for a holiday, making a sensation in her mistress’s
finery.</p>

<p>She led her lovely visitor into a little closet-like
room, in which were a bureau, two chairs, a table,
and a small stand, covered with a number of her
business hand-bills and a pack of cards. She asked
first: “What month was you born?” On receiving
the answer, the Astonisher took a book from the
bureau and read as follows: “A person born in
this month is of an amiable and frank disposition,
benevolent, and an amiable and desirable partner in
the marriage relation. Your lucky days are Tuesdays
and Thursdays, on which days you may enter
on any undertaking, or attempt any enterprise with
a good prospect of success.” Then she took up the
cards again, and after the usual shuffling and cutting,
the Astonisher fired away as follows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“You face luck, you face prosperity, you face true
love and disinterested affection, you face a speedy marriage,
you face a letter which will come in three days
and will contain pleasant news—you face a ring, you
face a present of jewelry done up in a small package;
the latter will come within two hours, two days, two
weeks, or two months—you face an agreeable surprise,
you face the death of a friend, you face the
seven of clubs which is the luckiest card in the pack—you
face two gentlemen with a view to matrimony,
one of whom has brown hair and brown eyes, and
the other has lighter hair and blue eyes—they are
both thinking of you at the present time, but the
nearest one you face is the one with light eyes—your
marriage runs within six or nine months.”</p>

<p>There was very much more to the same effect, but as
Johannes was pining all this time for a look at his
future husband, he did not pay the strictest attention
to it. Finally, when she had finished talking, she
said, “Step this way and see your future husband.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>”</p>

<p>This was the eventful moment.</p>

<p>The disguised one went to the table and there beheld
a pine box, about the size of an ordinary candle-box,
though shallower; it was unpainted, and decidedly
unornamental as an article of furniture. In one end
of it was an aperture about the size of the eye-hole of
a telescope; this was carefully covered with a small
black curtain. This mystic contrivance was placed
upon a table so low that the husband-seeker was
compelled to go on his knees to get his eye down
low enough to see through. He accomplished this
feat without grumbling, although his knees were
scarified by the whalebones which surrounded him.
The Astonisher then drew aside the little curtain
with a grand flourish, and her customer beheld an
indistinct figure of a bloated face with a mustache,
with black eyes and black hair; it was a hang-dog,
thief-like face, and one that he would not have passed
in the street without involuntarily putting his hands
on his pockets to assure himself that all was right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
But he felt that he had no hope of a future husband
if he did not accept this one, and he made up his
mind to be reconciled to the match.</p>

<p>This contrivance for showing the “future husband”
is sometimes called the Magic Mirror, and may
be procured at any optician’s for a dollar and a
quarter. The “future husband” may of course be
varied to suit circumstances, by merely shifting the
pictures at one end of the instrument; or a horse or a
dog might be substituted with equal propriety and
probability.</p>

<p>Disappointed, and sick at heart and stomach, the
Cash Customer bore away for home, and accomplished
the return voyage without disaster. He didn’t so
much mind the unexpected difference in the personal
attractions of Madame Morrow from what he had
hoped, for he had been rather accustomed to disappointments
of that sort of late, but he couldn’t see
that his admission to the camp of the enemy had
enabled him to spy out anything of particular advantage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to him in future operations. So he cogitated
and mournfully whistled slow tunes, as he cut
himself out of his unaccustomed harness by the help
of a pen-knife with a file-blade.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<hr />

<h3>DR. WILSON, No. 172 DELANCEY STREET.</h3>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">This</span> ignorant, half-imbecile old man is the only
<i>wizard</i> in New York whose fame has become public.
There are several other men who sometimes, as a
matter of favor to a curious friend, exercise their
astrological skill, but they do not profess witchcraft
as a means of living; they do not advertise their
gifts, but only dabble in necromancy in an amateur
way, more as a means of amusement than for any
other purpose. On the other hand Dr. Wilson freely
uses the newspapers to announce to the public his
star-reading ability, and his willingness, for a consideration,
to tell all events, past and future, of a
paying customer’s life. He professes to do all his
fortune-telling in a “strictly scientific” manner, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
it is but justice to him to say, that he alone, of all the
witches of New York, drew a horoscope, consulted
books of magic, made intricate mathematical calculations,
and made a show of being scientific. In his
case only was any attempt made to convince the
seeker after hidden wisdom, that modern fortune-telling
is aught else than very lame and shabby guesswork.
The old Doctor has by no means so many
customers as many of his female rivals; he is old
and unprepossessing—were he young and handsome
the case might be otherwise.</p>

<p>He has been a pretended “botanic physician,” or
what country people term a “root doctor;” but
failing to earn a living by the practice of medicine,
he took up “Demonology and Witchcraft” to aid
him to eke out a scanty subsistence. He does but
little in either branch of his business, the public
appearing to have slight faith in his ability
either to cure their maladies or foretell their
future.</p>

<p>The character of his surroundings is noted in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
following description, and his oracular communication
is given, word for word.</p>


<h4>An Hour with a Wizard.—The Cash Customer is to
“Pizon” his First Wife, and then get Another. Hooray!</h4>

<p>“I am like a vagabond pig with no family ties, who
has no lady pig to welcome him home o’nights, and
with no tender sucklings to call him ‘papa,’ in that
prattling porcine language that must fall so sweetly
on the ears of all parents of innocent porklings.
Like Othello, I have no wife, and really I can see
little hope in the future.”</p>

<p>Thus moralized the “Individual,” the morning
after his experiment with the women’s gear, and his
failure to learn, at a single lesson, the whole art of
catching a wife. Then he bethought him that perhaps
the art could not be learned without a master;
and then came the other thought that no one could
tell so well how to win a witch-wife as one who had
himself been successful in that risky experiment.</p>

<p>To find a man with a fortune-telling wife is no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
easy matter, for most of the marriages contracted by
these ladies are by no means of a permanent
character, and the male parties to the temporary
partnerships are always kept in the background.
But if he could discover up a wizard, a masculine
master of the Black Art, there were strong probabilities
that such an individual could put him in the
way of winning a miracle-working spouse, at the
very least possible trouble and expense. He would
seek that man as a preliminary to winning that
woman. The daily newspapers showed him that in
the person of a learned doctor, surnamed Wilson,
he would probably find the man he wanted. He
searched out that wonderful man, and the results
of his visit are given in this identical chapter.</p>

<p>Old dreamy Sol Gills, of coffee-colored memory,
has been admiringly recommended to the good
opinion of the world by his friend, Capt. Ed’ard
Cuttle, mariner of England, as a man “chock full
of science.” From the same eminent authority we
also learn that Jack Bunsby was an individual of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
learning so vast, and experience so varied and comprehensive,
that he never opened his oracular mouth
but out fell “solid chunks of wisdom.” That the
person now dwells in our city who combines the
scientific attainments of Gills with the intuitive
wisdom of Bunsby, we have the solemn word of
Johannes. The science is a trifle more dreamy and
misty even than of old, and the wisdom is solider
and chunkier, but both are as undeniable, as convincing,
as “stunning,” as in the best days of the
Little Wooden Midshipman. The fortunate possessor
of this inestimable wealth of knowledge secludes
himself from the curious public in the basement of
the house No. 172 Delancey street, like an underground
hermit. However, this unselfish and generous
sage, not wishing to hide entirely the light of
his great learning from a benighted world, kindly
condescends, in the advertisement herewith given,
to retail his wisdom to anxious inquirers at a dollar
a chunk:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Astrology.</span>—Dr. Wilson, 172 Delancey street, gives the
most scientific and reliable information to be found on all
concerns of life, past, present, and future. Terms—ladies, 50
cents; gentlemen, $1. Birth required.”</p></div>

<p>The last sentence is slightly obscure, and it was
not quite clear to Johannes that he would not have
to be “born again” on the premises. But at all
events there was something refreshing in the novelty
of consulting a “learned pundit” in pantaloons, after
all the tough conjurers of the other sex that he had
undergone of late.</p>

<p>So he repaired to Delancey street in a joyous
mood, nothing daunted by the requirements of the
advertisement.</p>

<p>Delancey street is not Paradise, quite the contrary.
In fact it may be set down as unsavory, not to say
dirty in the extreme. The man that can walk
through the east end of this delicious thoroughfare
without a constant sensation of sea-sickness, has a
stomach that would be true to him in a dissecting-room.
The individual that can explore with his
unwilling boots its slimy depths without a feeling of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the most intense disgust for everything in the city
and of the city, ought to live in Delancey street and
buy his provisions at the corner grocery. He never
ought to see the country, or even to smell the breath
of a country cow. He should be exiled to the city;
be banished to perpetual bricks and mortar; be condemned
to a never-ending series of omnibus rides,
and to innumerable varieties of short change.</p>

<p>The delegate picked his way gingerly enough,
thinking all the while that if Leander had been compelled
to wade through Delancey street, instead of
taking a clean swim across the sea, Hero might have
died a respectable old maid for all Leander. And
yet Johannes says he doesn’t believe that History
will give <i>him</i> any credit for his valorous navigation
of the said street.</p>

<p>He at last reached the designated spot, sound as to
body, though wofully soiled as to garments, and
approached the semi-subterranean abode of the great
prophet, and immediately after his modest rap at the
basement door, was met by the venerable sage in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
person. He walked in, and then proceeded to take
an observation of the cabalistic instruments and
mysterious surroundings of the great philosopher.</p>

<p>The room was a small, low apartment, about ten
feet by twelve, the floor uncarpeted and uneven; the
walls were damp, and the whole place was like a
vault. The furniture was very scanty, and all had
an unwholesome moisture about it, and a curious
odor, as if it gathered unhealthy dews by being kept
underground. Three feeble chairs were all the seats,
and a table which leaned against the wall was too ill
and rickety to do its intended duty; many of the
books which had once probably covered it, were now
thrown in a promiscuous heap on the floor, where
they slowly mildewed and gave out a graveyard smell.
A miniature stove in the middle of the room, sweated
and sweltered, and in its struggles to warm the
unhealthy atmosphere had succeeded in suffusing
itself with a clammy perspiration; it was in the last
stages of debility; old age and abuse had used it
sadly, and it now stood helplessly upon its crippled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
legs, and supported its nerveless elbow upon a sturdy
whitewash brush. There were a few symptoms of
medical pretensions in the shape of some vials, and
bottles of drugs, and colored liquids on the mantelpiece;
a great attempt at a display of scientific apparatus
began and ended with an insulating stool, and
an old-fashioned “cylinder and cushion” electrical
machine; a number of highly-colored prints of
animals pasted on the wall, having evidently been
scissored from the show-bill of a menagerie, had a
look towards natural history, and a jar or two of
acids suggested chemical researches. The books
that still remained on the enervated table were an
odd volume of Braithwaite’s Retrospect, a treatise
on Human Physiology, and another on Materia
Medica; a number of bound volumes of Zadkiel’s
Astronomical Ephemeris, Raphael’s Prophetic Almanac,
Raphael’s Prophetic Messenger, and a file of
Robert White’s Celestial Atlas, running back to
1808.</p>

<p>The appearance of the venerable sage of Delancey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
street was not so imposing as to strike a stranger
with awe—quite the contrary. He partook of the
character of the room, and was a fitting occupant of
such a place; he seemed some kind of unwholesome
vegetable that had found that noisome atmosphere
congenial, and had sprung indigenously from the
slimy soil. One looked instinctively at his feet to see
what kind of roots he had, and then glanced back at
his head as if it were a huge bud, and about to blossom
into some unhealthy flower. The traces of its
earthy origin were plainly visible about this mouldy
old plant; quantities of the rank soil still adhered to
the face, filled up the wrinkles of the cheeks, found
ample lodging in the ears and on the neck, and
crowding under the horny and distorted nails, made
them still more ugly; and streaks and ridges of dirt
clung to every portion of the garments, which
answered to the bark or rind of this perspiring herb.</p>

<p>To drop this botanic figure of speech, Dr. Wilson
is a man of about fifty-eight years of age, rather stout
and thick-set, with grey eyes, and hair which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
once brown, but is now grey, and with thin brown
whiskers; the top of his head is nearly bald, except
a few thin, furzy, short hairs, which made his skull
look as if it had been kept in that damp room until
mould had gathered on it. He was in his shirt sleeves,
and was attired, for the most part, in a pair of sheep’s
grey pantaloons, which were made to cover that fraction
of his body between his ankles and his armpits;
the little patch of shirt that was visible above the
waistband of that garment, was streaked with irregular
lines of dirty black, as if it had gone into half
mourning for the scarcity of water.</p>

<p>The man of science made a musty remark or two
about the weather and the walking, and then, after
carefully seating himself at the decrepit table, he
said: “I suppose your business is of a fortun’-tellin’
natur; if so, my terms is one dollar.” The affirmative
answer to the question and the payment of the
dollar put new energy into the mouldy old man, and
he prepared to astonish the beholder.</p>

<p>He demanded the age of his visitor, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
desired to be informed of the date of his birth, with
particular reference to the exact time of day;
Johannes drummed up his youthful recollections of
that interesting event, and gave the day, the hour,
and the minute, with his accustomed accuracy. The
sage made an exact minute of these wet-nurse items
on a cheap slate with a stub of a pencil; then taking
another cheap slate, he proceeded to draw a horoscope
thereon, pausing a little over the signs of the zodiac,
as if he was a little out in his astronomy, and wasn’t
exactly certain whether there should be twelve or
twenty. He settled this little matter by filling one
half the slate as full as it would hold, and then carrying
some to the other side, so as to have a few on
hand in case of any emergency.</p>

<p>When the figure was drawn, and all the mysterious
signs completed, the shirt-sleeve prophet became
absorbed in an intricate calculation of such mysterious
import that all his customer’s mathematical
proficiency was unable to make out what it was all
about. First he set down a long row of figures,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
which he added together with much difficulty, and
then seemed to instantly conceive the most unrelenting
hostility to the sum total. The mathematical
tortures to which he put that unhappy amount; the
arithmetical abuse which he heaped upon it, and
the algebraic contumely with which he overwhelmed
it, almost defy description. He first belabored
it with the four simple rules; he stretched it
with Addition; he cut it in two with Subtraction;
he made it top-heavy with Multiplication,
and tore it to pieces with Division—then he extracted
its square root; then extracted the cube
root of that, which left nothing of the unfortunate
sum total but a small fraction, which he then divided
by <i>ab</i>, and made “equal to” an infinitesimal part of
some unknown <i>x</i>. Having thus wreaked his vengeance
on the unhappy number, he laid away the
surviving fraction in a cold corner of the slate, where
he left it, first, however, giving a parting token of
his bitter malignity by writing the minus sign before
it, which made it perpetually worse than nothing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and reduced it to a state of irredeemable algebraic
bankruptcy. This praiseworthy object being finally
achieved, he proceeded to translate into intelligible
English the result of his calculations, which he
announced in the terms following:</p>

<p>“The testimonial is not the most sanguine. If the
time of birth is given correct there is reason to
apprehend that something of an affective nature
occurred at about eight years and ten months—at
16&nbsp;×&nbsp;10 I think I may say, if the time of birth is
given correct, there is from the figures reason to
expect that there is a probability of a similar sitiwation
of events. At 24 there was a favorable sitiwation
of events, if there was not somebody or somethin’
afflictive on the contrary, the which I am disposed
to think might be possible. At 25, if the time of
birth is given correct, there is reason to expect great
likelihoods of some success in life; I may, it is true,
be mistaken in my calculations, but as the significators
are angular, I think there is indications that such
will be the sitiwation of events. At 30, if the time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of birth is given correct, I think you are an individdyal
as may look for some species of misfortin—there
will be some rather singular circumstances
occur, which might denote loss of friends, or the
fallin’ to you of a fortin, or great travellin’ by water
or land, or losin’ money at cards, or breakin’ your
leg, or makin’ a great discovery, or inventin’ somethin’,
or gettin’ put into prison on suspicion of
sorcery and witchcraft. You will see that there are
indications to denote that you will certainly be
accused of sorcery and witchcraft by some individdyals
who are not your friends—the indications
denote great likelihoods that this will make you
uneasy in your mind, but I think there is nothin’
of a very serious natur’ to be feared at that time of
life, if the time of birth is given correct. When any
misfortin’ is comin’ upon you there is no doubt
(though I am not goin’ to state positively that such
will be the case, still there is strong likelihoods that
the indications give such a probability) that it will
give you warnin’ of its approach. At 36, if the time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of birth is given correct, there is indications of a
likelihood that you will fall upon some other misfortin’;
I am not prepared to state positively that such
will be the case, but I think you will have a misfortin’,
though I don’t think it would be of a very
afflictive natur’. There is at that time a circumstance
of an unfriendly natur’, though it may not happen
to yourself; it might denote that your brother will
get sick. There is another evil condition about this
time which I will examine still furder. I see that
there is indications of a likelihood that there is a
probability of your having somethin’ amiss by a
partner, if somethin’ of a favorable natur’ does
not interpose, which is not unlikely, though I may
be mistaken and will not say positively. You will
be lucky, however, after that, and many of your evils
will gradually begin to recline, as it were. There is
reason to believe that the significators denote that in
the course of your futur’ life you will sometimes be
thrown in with men who you will think is your
friends, but who will prove to be your enemy. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
I will not say positively, for I may be mistaken,
which I think I am not, but if the time of birth is
correct, you are an individdyal as gives likelihoods
that such might be the case.”</p>

<p>For more than an hour had the Inquirer been
edified and instructed by these “solid chunks of
wisdom,” which, it will be remembered, were not
delivered off-hand, but were carefully ciphered out
by elaborate calculations on the slate aforesaid.
Lucid and elegant as was the language, and interesting
as was the matter of these oracular communications,
he felt it to be his duty to interrupt them
for a time and change the subject to a theme in
which he felt a nearer interest; accordingly he asked
the musty Seer about his prospects of future wedded
bliss. This was a subject of so great importance
that all the other calculations had to be erased from
the slate—this little operation was accomplished in
the manner of the schoolboys who haint got any
sponge, and the dirty hand plied briskly for a minute
between the juicy mouth and the dingy slate, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
became a shade grimier by this cleanly process.
Then a new horoscope was drawn with more signs of
the zodiac than ever, and in due time the result was
thus announced:</p>

<p>“I shall now endeavor to give you a description
of the sort of person you might be most likeliest to
marry. There is indications that your wife might be
respectable. The significators do not denote that
there is a likelihood that you might marry a very
old woman. She would be as likely to have fair hair
and blue eyes as anything else; nor would she be
likely to be very much too tall, and I don’t imagine
you are an individdyal that might be likely to marry
a woman who was very short. She may not be very
old, but I do not think that the indications point her
out as being likely to be a child; in fact, I think it
possible that she may be of the ordinary age, though
I do not wish to be understood as being positive on
all these points, for I may be mistaken, though I
think you will find that there is a likelihood that
these things may be so. You will be married twice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and I think you are an individdyal that would be
likely to have children—six children I think there is
indications that you may be likely to have. The
significators point out one very evil condition, and I
think I may say that I’m quite sure. I’m positive
that you will separate from your first wife. No, I
will not say that yours is a quarrelsome natur’, but
the significators look bad. Things is worse, in fact,
than I told you of, and now I look again and am
sure you are prepared, I will say that there cannot
be a doubt that <i>you will pizon your first wife</i>. It cannot
be any other way; there is no mistake; it is so;
it must be true; the fact is this, and thus I tell you,
<i>you will pizon your first wife</i>. And, my young friend,
I will advise you, in case your married futur’ is
unhappy, and you do find it necessary to give pizon
to your consort, do not tell anybody of your intentions;
do not let it be known; and you must do it in
such a way as not to be suspected, or people will
think hard of you, and there may be trouble.”</p>

<p>This was a touch of wisdom for which Johannes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
was not prepared; so he snatched his hat and hastily
left the sepulchral premises, conscious of his inability
to receive another such a “chunk” without being
completely floored.</p>

<p>He now expresses the opinion that Dr. Wilson
wanted to get the job of “pizoning” that first wife,
and that he would have done it with pleasure at less
than the market price.</p>

<hr />

<h3>MRS. HAYES, A CLAIRVOYANT, No. 176 GRAND
STREET.</h3>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">There</span> are a dozen or more of these “Clairvoyants”
in the city who profess to cure diseases, and to work
other wonders by the aid of their so-called wonderful
power. As their mode of proceeding is very much
the same in all cases, a description of one or two will
give an idea of the whole. Their principal business
is to prescribe for bodily ills, and did they confine
themselves to this alone, they would not be legitimate
subjects of mention in this book. But in addition to
their medical practice they also tell about “absent
friends;” tell whether projected business undertakings
will fall out well or ill; whether contemplated marriages
will be prosperous or otherwise: whether a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
person will be “lucky” in life, whether his children
will be happy, and, in short, they do pretty much the
regular fortune-telling routine, whenever the questions
of the customer lead that way.</p>

<p>The theory as given by them, of a Clairvoyant
diagnosis of a malady, is this: that the Clairvoyant,
when thrown by mesmeric influence into the “trance”
state, is enabled to <i>see into the body of the patient</i> and
discern what organs, if any, are deranged, and in what
manner; or to ascertain precisely the nature of the
morbific condition of the body, and having thus
discovered what part of the vital mechanism is out of
order, they are able, they argue, to prescribe the best
means for restoring the apparatus to a normal state.</p>

<p>There are many thousands of persons who believe
this stuff, and endanger their lives and health by
trusting to these empirics. Several of the most popular
of them have as many patients as they can attend to,
and are rapidly amassing fortunes. Most of them have
a superficial knowledge of Medicine, and are thus
enabled to do, with a certain amount of impunity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
many dark deeds. It is reported of more than one of
these women that she has done as many deeds of child-murder
as did even the notorious Madame Restell.</p>

<p>In this regard, they are among the most dangerous
and criminal of all the Witches.</p>

<p>The “Individual” visited Mrs. Hayes, who is one
of the most ignorant of the whole lot, and Mrs. Seymour,
who is one of the most intelligent of all. He
sets down the particulars of his visit to the former, in
the words following:</p>


<h4>How the “Individual” sees a Clairvoyant—How he pays a
Dollar, and what he gets for his money.</h4>

<p>Not all the sorcery of all the sorcerers; not all the
necromancy of all the necromancers; not all the conjurations
of all masculine conjurers; not all the magic
of all male magicians; not all the charming of all the
charmers, charm they never so wisely, could have
induced Johannes to ever more place the slightest trust
in a wizard, or repose in any wonderworker of the
bearded sex the merest trifle of faith, even the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
infinitesimal trituration of the homœopathicest grain.
The single dose he had received from the renowned
Doctor Wilson was quite enough, and had satisfied all
his longings for wisdom of that sort.</p>

<p>Besides, his coming events cast such peculiar and
very unpleasant shadows before, that he preferred to
keep out of the grim presence of such shady men,
and for all after time to bask him only in the sunshine
of smiling women.</p>

<p>“<i>Pizon his first wife</i>,” would he? Well, he could
have taken that “pizon” with tolerable composure
from the lips of lovely woman, but to receive it
from the mumbling mouth of a skinny old man, was
too much to accept without divers rebellious grins.</p>

<p>A peach-cheeked witch, a cherry-lipped conjuress;
a Circe, with only enough charms to make a respectable
photograph, might with impunity have called him
a counterfeiter, or a horse-thief, or even a thimble-rigger;
or might have told him that he would, upon
opportunity, garotte his grandmother for the small
price of seventy cents and her snuff-box; or that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
was in the habit of attending funerals to pick the
pockets of the mourners, and of going to church that
he might steal the pennies from the poor-box, all this
would he have borne uncomplainingly from a woman;
but these unpalatable statements from one of the masculine
gender would be “most tolerable and not to be
endured.”</p>

<p>He felt that if he had not rushed incontinently
from the presence of that underground star-gazer Dr.
Wilson, he must either have punched that respected
person’s venerated head, or have laughed in his
honored face. In either case he would, of course,
have roused the extensive ire of that potent worthy,
and have been at once exposed to a fire of supernatural
influences that would have been probably
unpleasant, to say the least.</p>

<p>The unmusical Johannes looks upon accordeons as
cruel instruments of refined torture, and detests them
as the vilest of all created or invented things, and he
had been very careful to offend none of the magic
community, lest he should, by some high-pressure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
power of their enchanted spells, be transformed into
an accordeon, and be condemned to eternally have
shrieking music pulled out of his bowels by unrelenting
boys.</p>

<p>Having this terrible possible doom continually
before his mind’s optics, he felt that it would be only
the part of prudence to avoid the company of those
black art professors in whose presence he could not
keep all his feelings well in hand. So, no more
wizards would he visit, but the witches should henceforth
have his entire attention.</p>

<p>It is a fortunate circumstance that there are no other
men than the aforesaid Doctor Wilson, in the witch
business in New York, so that there would be no
temptation to break this resolve, and he probably
would not be troubled to keep it.</p>

<p>There is one breed of the modern witch that pretends
to a sort of superiority in blood and manners,
and those who practise this peculiar branch of the
business put on certain aristocratic airs and utterly
refuse to consort with those of another stamp. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
disdain the title of “Astrologers,” or “Astrologists,”
as most of them phrase it, and in their advertisements
utterly repudiate the idea that they are “Fortune
Tellers.”</p>

<p>These are the “Clairvoyants,” who do business by
means of certain select mummeries of their own, and
who make a great deal of money in their trade.
There are a great number of these in the city, so many
indeed that the business is over-done, and the price
of retail clairvoyance has come materially down.
The same dose of this article that formerly cost five
dollars, may now be had for fifty cents, and the
quality is not deteriorated, but is quite as good now
as it ever was.</p>

<p>To one of these supernatural women did the hero
resolve to pay his next visit, and he selected the abode
of Mrs. Hayes, of 176 Grand Street, for his initiatory
consultation.</p>

<p>With the mysterious psychological phenomena denominated
by those who profess to know them best,
“clairvoyant manifestations,” Johannes had nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
to do, and was content, as every one of the uninitiated
must perforce be, to accept the say-so of the spiritualistic
journals that there are such phenomena and that
they are unexplained and mysterious. No outside
unbelievers in Spiritualism and the kindred arts may
ever know anything of clairvoyant developments and
demonstrations, save such one-sided varnished statements
as the journals that deal in that sort of
commodities choose to lay before the world. Every
man must be spiritually wound up to concert pitch
before he is in a condition to receive the highest
revelations of the clairvoyant speculators. So that,
whether the clairvoyance that is sold for money be a
spurious or a superfine article few can tell. Certain it
is that it is the same sort of stuff that has ever been
retailed to the public under the name of clairvoyance,
ever since the discovery of that remunerative humbug.
It is more than likely that the twaddle of Mrs. Hayes,
Mrs. Seymour, and the rest of the fortune-telling
crew, would be repudiated by Andrew Jackson Davis
and the rest of the spiritualistic firstchoppers, but it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
is none the less true that these gifted women sell their
pretended knowledge of spirits and spiritual persons
and things, with as much pretentiousness to unerring
truth, as that veritable seer himself, and at a much
lower price.</p>

<p>The clairvoyant department of modern witchcraft is
necessarily carried on by a partnership, and one which
is not identical with the legendary league with the
devil. Two visible persons constitute the firm, for it
takes a double team to do the work, and if the amiable
gentleman just referred to makes a third in the concern,
he is a silent partner who merely furnishes capital,
while his name is not known in the business. The
whole theory of clairvoyance as applied to fortune-telling
and other branches of cheap necromancy, seems
to be somewhat like this.</p>

<p>A strong-minded person, generally a man with a
<i>physique</i> like a Centre-Market butcher boy, obtains by
some means possession of an extra soul or two, or spirit,
or whatever else that intangible thing may be called.
These spirits are always second-rate articles, not good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
enough to be put into vigorous and strong bodies, and
which have been therefore hastily cased up in an
inferior kind of human frame as a sort of make-shift
for men and women.</p>

<p>Your professional clairvoyant is always, both as to
soul and body, a botched-up job that nature ought to
be ashamed of, and probably is, if she’d own up.</p>

<p>The senior partner of the clairvoyant fortune-telling
firm, the strong-minded one, according to their professions,
has the arbitrary control of the cast-off souls
that animate these refuse bodies. By what spiritual
hocus-pocus this is managed is not known to those
outside the trade. He uses their half-baked spirits
at his will, and makes his living by farming them out
to do dirty jobs for the paying public. He disconnects
them from their mortal vehicles, and sends them
on errands in the spirit-land in behalf of his customers,
looking up their “absent friends,” both in and
out of the body—telling of their health and prosperity
if they are still alive, and picking up little bits of scandal
about their angels if they are dead. The senior<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
partner also sends his abject two-and-sixpenny souls
to explore the bodies of his sick customers and
examine their internal machinery, point out any little
defects or disarrangements, and suggest the proper
remedies therefor, and in short, to do whatever other
dirty work the customer may choose to pay for.</p>

<p>The senior partner of course pockets all the money,
merely keeping the mortal tenement in which the
working partner dwells in a good state of repair, in
consideration of services rendered.</p>

<p>Such a partnership is the one of Mr. and Mrs.
Hayes, whose place of business is advertised every
day in the morning papers in the words following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Clairvoyance.</span>—Astonishing cures and great discoveries
daily made by <span class="smcap">Mrs. Hayes</span>, that superior and wonderful clairvoyant.
All diseases discovered and cured (if curable). Unerring
advice given respecting persons in business, absent friends,
&amp;c. Satisfactory examinations given in all cases, or no charge
made. Residence, 176 Grand St. N.&nbsp;Y.”</p></div>

<p>Johannes, whose general health was excellent, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
whose internal apparatus was all right so far as heard
from, had therefore no occasion to be astonishingly
cured, or to have any great discoveries made in him
by Mrs. Hayes; still he was desirous of a little “unerring
advice about absent friends,” etc., from “that
superior and wonderful clairvoyant.”</p>

<p>Besides, it was barely possible that in the person
of the superior and wonderful Mrs. Hayes, he might
find the bride for whom he pined. With hope slightly
renewed within his speculative breast, he set off joyfully
for the designated domicile, which he achieved
in the due course of travel.</p>

<p>The house No. 176 Grand Street is a brick two-story
dwelling, of a dingy drab color, as though it had
been steeped in a Quaker atmosphere and had there
imbibed its color, which had since been overlaid with
“world’s people’s” dirt.</p>

<p>The door was opened by Mrs. Hayes in person, her
body on this occasion being sent with her spirit to
do a bit of drudgery.</p>

<p>She is a woman of the most abject and cringing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
manner imaginable; a female counterpart of Uriah
Heep, with an unknown multiplication of that vermicular
gentleman’s writhings; she wore no hoops, she
would have squirmed herself out of them in an instant;
her dress was fastened securely on with numerous
visible hooks and eyes, and pins, and strings, in spite
of which precautions her visitor expected to see her
worm out of it before she got up stairs, and would
scarcely have been astonished to see her jerk her
skeleton out of her skin, and complete her errand in
her bones.</p>

<p>With a propitiating bow, whose intense servility
would have become Mr. Sampson Brass in the day of
his discomfiture, she asked her customer into the
house, cringingly preceded him up stairs, deferentially
placed a chair, and abjectly departed into an inner
room, pausing at the door to execute an obsequious
wriggle, and to once more humble herself in the dust
(of which there was plenty) before her astonished
visitor.</p>

<p>The reception-room to which she led him, is an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
apartment of moderate size, from the front windows
of which the beholder may regale his eyes with a comprehensive
view of Centre Market and its charming
surroundings; Mott and Mulberry Streets lie just
beyond, and the Tombs are visible in the dim distance.
The room was furnished with a superfluity of gaudy
furniture; and sofas, tables, chairs and pictures,
crowded and elbowed each other, showing plainly
that the upholstery of a couple, at least, of parlors had
been there compressed into a bedroom.</p>

<p>From the inner room came a great sound, made up
of so many household ingredients as to defy accurate
analysis—but the crying of babies, the frizzling of
cooking meat, the scraping of saucepans, and a sound
of somebody scolding everybody else, predominated.</p>

<p>The voyager was unprepared for any <i>Mister</i> Hayes,
having taken it for granted that the <i>Mrs.</i> of the superior
and wonderful clairvoyant did not imply a husband,
but was merely assumed because it looks more
dignified in the advertisement. But there <i>was</i> a <i>Mr.</i>
Hayes, and presently the door opened and that worthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
appeared; he was surrounded by an atmosphere
of fried onions, and the fragrant and greasy perspiration
in his face seemed to have been distilled from
that favorite vegetable.</p>

<p>Mr. Hayes is a tall, fierce, sharp-spoken man, of
manners so very rough and bearish that his wife and
children quailed when he spoke as if they expected an
instant blow. We don’t know that it ever will be
possible for a man to garrote his guardian angel for
the sake of her golden crown, but the idea occurred
to Johannes that if that amiable feat is ever accomplished,
it will be by such another man as this. He
seemed as unable to speak a kind or gentle word as to
pull his boots off over his ears. He is an Englishman,
and speaks with the most intolerable cockney accent.
Moderating his harsh tones until they were almost as
pleasant as the threatenings of an ill-natured bull-dog,
and addressing his auditor, he growled out the following
specimen of delectable English:</p>

<p>“There is lots of folks goin’ round town pretendin’
to do clairvoyance, and to cure sick folks, and to tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
fortunes, and business, and journeys, and stole property;
but we ain’t none of them people. We only
do this for the sake of doin’ good, and we don’t want
to do nothin’ that will make any trouble. We used
to tell things about stole property, and about family
troubles, and so we sometimes used to get folks into
musses, but we don’t do nothin’ of that kind now.
If your business is about any kind of muss and trouble
in your family we don’t want nothin’ to do with it.
Sometimes folks that has quarrelled their wives away
come to us and wants us to get them back again, but
we don’t do nothing of that sort. We can tell ’em if
their wives are well, or if they’re sick and all about
what ails ’em, and so we can about any people that is
gone off anywhere, and them’s what we call ‘absent
friends.’ So if you’ve got any trouble with your wife
we can’t do nothin’ for you.”</p>

<p>The love-lorn visitor had no wives, a fact known to
the reader already, and when he does accumulate a
help-meet, he sincerely trusts she may not be so unruly
as to require the interference of outsiders to preserve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
harmony in the family. He expressed himself to that
effect, and added that his business was to find out
about the well-being of some friends in Minnesota, and
to ascertain particulars about some other trifles necessary
to his peace of mind.</p>

<p>Hereupon Mr. Hayes, with a growl like a sulky
rhinoceros, opened the door which cut off the pot-and-kettle
Babel of the other room, and commanded his
wife to come, and that estimable lady, who is evidently
in a state of excellent subordination, instantly writhed
herself into the room. She sat down in an armchair,
and began to evolve a most remarkable series of
inane smiles, each one of which began somewhere
down her throat, rose to her mouth by jerks, and
finally faded away at the top of her head and the tips
of her ears. It was a purely spasmodic thing of disagreeable
habit, without a particle of geniality or
feeling about it.</p>

<p>While this curious process was going on, the Doctor
had drawn down the window-shades, thus darkening
the room, and now approached for the purpose of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
unhooking from its earthly tabernacle the soul that
was to step up to Minnesota and bring back word to
his customer “how all the folks got along.” This he
accomplished by a few mysterious mesmeric passes,
and when the trance was induced, and the spirit had,
so to speak, tucked its breeches into its boots ready
for the muddy journey, he placed in the hand of
Johannes that of the corpus which still remained in
the armchair, and said to the disembodied spirit:</p>

<p>“Now, I want you to go with this gentleman to
Brooklyn and take a fair start from there, and then go
where he tells you to, and tell him what things there
is there that you see.”</p>

<p>Having delivered this injunction in a tone so indescribably
savage that he had better a thousand times
have struck her in the face, this amiable animal
retired to the Babel, taking with him the fried-onion
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Then the woman in the chair began to speak, in a
style the most disagreeable and affected that anybody
ever listened to. It was more like that sickening gibberish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
that nurses call “<i>baby-talk</i>,” than anything
else in the world. She spoke with a detestable whine,
and pronounced each syllable of every word separately,
as if she feared a two-syllable word might choke
her. Sick at the stomach as was her visitor at the
whole babyish performance, he so far controlled his
qualms as to note down the words hereunder written.</p>

<p>Whoever has heard this woman in a professional
way can testify to the verbatim truth of this
sketch.</p>

<p>“There is wa-ter that we must cross, we must go
in a boat musn’t we? Now we’re in the boat, and O
I see so many put-ty things, men, and dogs, and ships
and things going up and down; such beau-ti-ful things
I have never seened before. Now we are a-cross the
riv-er, and now we must get on the car, musn’t we?
What car must we get on? O I see it now, the yellow
car. Now we are going a-long and I can see—O
what a pret-ty dress in that store. O what real nice
can-dy that is. I wish I had some don’t you? Now
we’re at the house. Is it the one on the cor-ner, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the next one to it, or is it the brick house with the
green blinds? No, the wood one with green blinds;
so it is, but I didn’t be here be-fore ev-er in my life.
Now we will go in-to the house; I see a car-pet there
and some chairs and some—O what a pret-ty pic-ture,
and what a nice fire. I see a la-dy of ver-y pret-ty
ap-pear-ance. She is a young la-dy; she has got blue
eyes, she is stand-ing sideways so I can’t see noth-ing
of her but one side of her face. There is al-so an
el-der-ly la-dy, but I can’t see much of her. They appear
to be go-ing on a jour-ney, shall I go with them?
Yes, well I will. Now we are on the wa-ter and—O
what a pret-ty boat—now we are get-ting off of the
boat—I didn’t nev-er be here be-fore. Now we
are on a rail-road, I nev-er seened this rail-road
be-fore but—O what a pret-ty ba-by. Now we
go along, along, along, along, and now we are at the
de-pot. I didn’t ev-er be here ei-ther—there is a
riv-er here, and a mill and a—O what a pret-ty cow—somebody
is go-ing to milk the cow. There is a town
here—it seems as if I did be here before—yes I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
sure—O what a pret-ty lit-tle car-riage, and what a
pret-ty dog. Yes I am sure I seened this town be-fore,
but these rail-roads didn’t be here then.”</p>

<p>By this time the travellers were supposed to have
reached St. Paul, and the reliable clairvoyant then
proceeded to describe that interesting young city; and
in the course of her speech made more improvements
there than will be accomplished in reality in less than
a year or two certainly.</p>

<p>Among other things, Mrs. Hayes described as at
present existing in St. Paul, two Colleges, a City Hall
built of white marble, a locomotive factory, and a
place where they were building seven ocean steamers.</p>

<p>She then, when she arrived at the house, in the
course of her mesmeric journey, where the people
concerning whom Johannes had inquired were supposed
to be at that present domiciled, proceeded to
give descriptions of those whom she saw there, of the
looks of the country and of the house.</p>

<p>And <i>such</i> descriptions, as much like the truth as a
ton of “T” rail is like a boiled custard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>By asking leading questions the seeker after clairvoyant
knowledge got some very original information.
He only began this course after he found that she,
if left to herself, could describe nothing, and could
utter no speech more coherent or sensible than that
already set down as coming from her illustrious lips.</p>

<p>In fact, the policy of the clairvoyant-witch in every
case, is to wait for leading questions from the anxious
inquirer, so that the answers may be framed to suit the
exigencies of the case. Johannes was not slow to
perceive this, and by way of testing the science, or
rather, art of clairvoyance, he put a series of questions
which established the following interesting facts, all
of which were positively averred to be true by Mrs.
Hayes, “that superior and wonderful clairvoyant.”</p>

<p>Minnesota Territory is a small town situated 911
miles south-east of the mouth of the Mississippi River—its
officers are a chief cook and 23 high privates,
besides the younger brother of Shakspeare, who is the
Mayor of the Territory, and whose principal business it
is to keep the American flag at half-mast, upside down.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>When this last important information had been elicited,
Johannes, who thought he had got the worth
of his money, recalled Dr. Hayes, who reappeared,
surrounded by the same old atmosphere of the same
old onions; to him the customer resigned the hand
of the twaddling adult baby who had held his hand
for an hour and a half, paid his dollar, and then prepared
to depart.</p>

<p>The soul of the woman then returned from its long
journey, and was locked up in its squirmy body by
the Doctor, ready to serve future customers at one
dollar a head.</p>

<p>She didn’t seem glad to get her soul back again,
there probably not being enough to give her any great
joy, after she had got it.</p>

<p>Johannes turned moodily away, feeling that the
conjuress, his future bride, the renovator of his broken
fortunes, and the ready relief to his present necessities,
was as far distant as ever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<h3>MRS. SEYMOUR, CLAIRVOYANT, No. 110 SPRING
STREET.</h3>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">This</span> woman is at the same time one of the most
pretentious and most clever of the clairvoyants, and
she does a very large business. Most of her customers
come for medical advice, although, in accordance with
her printed announcement, she is willing to talk about
“absent friends,” and whatever other business the
client may choose to pay for.</p>

<p>One branch of the clairvoyant trade which formerly
brought as much money to their pockets as any other
department of their business, was the finding lost or
stolen property, and giving directions for the detection
of the thieves. This specialty has however been pretty
much abandoned of late by nearly all of them, in consequence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of law-proceedings against certain ones of
the sisterhood, which have in three or four instances
been commenced by parties who have been wrongfully
accused of theft, through the agency of the clairvoyant
impostors. Several suits have been instituted against
them for defamation of character, and they have been
made to smart so severely that they are now all very
careful about accusing persons of crimes.</p>

<p>As an evidence of the implicit faith put in these
people by their dupes, it may be mentioned that many
applications have been made to Judge Welsh, of this
city, and to the other judges, for warrants of arrest
against respectable persons, for theft, the only grounds
of suspicion against them being, that some clairvoyant
had said that the property had been stolen by a
person of such and such a height, with hair and eyes
of this or that color, and that the suspected person
happened to answer the description. Of course, all
such applications for legal process have been refused
by the magistrates, and the applicants dismissed with
a severe rebuke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Seymour was an intimate friend of Mrs. Cunningham,
of the Burdell-murder notoriety, and was a
witness in that memorable trial.</p>

<p>The Cash Customer had an interview with this
woman, which he thus describes:</p>


<h4>Another Clairvoyant, who is not much in particular.</h4>

<p>If a man be desirous of knowing what sort of a
moral character he bears in the spirit-world, and
what style of society his disembodied soul will circulate
in, or if he desires to know the particulars of the
after-death behavior of any of his acquaintances, of
course he will find it to his interest to marry a
“medium” of average respectability, and in good
practice, and so save the expense of frequent consultations.
The “rapping” and “table-tipping” communications
from the spirit-world are hardly satisfactory.
It is, very likely, pleasant for a man to be on
speaking terms with his bedroom furniture, to spend
an agreeable hour occasionally in conversation with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
his washhand-stand, to enjoy a spirited argument
with his bedstead and rocking-chair, or to receive
now and then a confidential communication from his
bootjack, but on the whole, these upholstery dialogues
do not satisfy the “yearnings of the soul after the
infinite.” The powers of speech of a washhand-stand
are circumscribed, bedsteads and rocking-chairs are
seldom equal to a sustained conversation, and the
most talkative bootjack has not a sufficient command
of language to make itself agreeable for any great
length of time. The logic of a poker may sometimes
be convincing, but it is not generally agreeable; and
the rhetoric of uneducated coal-scuttles is hardly
elegant enough to pass the criticism of a refined taste.
It is therefore much more satisfactory as well as economical,
for a person who desires to enjoy his daily chat
with the Spirits, to get a “speaking medium” to
translate the eloquence of all parties and make the
thing pleasant. Even then, confidential communications
must be very guarded, and on this account the
person who invents some means by which every man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
can be his own medium, will win an equal immortality
with the author of that invaluable book, “Every
Man his own Washerwoman.”</p>

<p>Johannes had been thinking over the spiritual subject,
of course with a view to profitable matrimony, for
he thought he could manage to turn an intimacy with
the spirits to good pecuniary account, and inveigle
those incorporeal gentlemen into doing something for
those of their friends who are yet bothered with bodies.</p>

<p>He knew that there are in New York, plenty of
spiritualists in such constant communication with their
acquaintances on the “other side of Jordan,” that
they know the bill of fare with which those seventh-heaveners
are served every day, and whenever their
jolly ghostships sit down to a pleasant game of whist,
they send word to their earthly relatives by “medium”
every fresh deal, what the new trump is, who hold the
honors, and how the game stands generally.</p>

<p>So close a familiarity with superior beings as this,
could be easily turned to practical account and made
to pay handsomely, by a Spiritualist with a utilitarian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
turn of mind. If he could but get his spirits into
proper subjection how useful would they not be in
the patent medicine business, in the way of inventing
new remedies; how invaluable would they be to an
editor; in fact, how particularly useful in almost any
kind of business.</p>

<p>But his great plan was to train a corps of light-footed
and gentle ghosts to carry news; they would of course
beat locomotives, carrier pigeons, and electric telegraphs
out of sight; seas, mountains, and such trifling
obstacles would be no hindrance to them, and the
Associated Press, to say nothing of the Board of
Brokers, would pay handsomely for their services.
Of course a ghost with any pretensions to speed would
bring us detailed news from London in half-an-hour
or so, without putting himself out of breath in the
least, thus beating the telegraph by a length. And
so Johannes, fully determined on this promising
scheme, began to cast about him for a medium who
was acquainted in the spirit sphere, to introduce him
to some of the eligible ghosts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>He knew that most of the clairvoyant women are
“mediums,” and thought very naturally that women
who already earned their living by clairvoyance,
would be the very ones to enter heart and soul with
him into his spiritualistic scheme.</p>

<p>Yes, he would marry a medium, and if she was a
professional clairvoyant, so much the better, his bow
would have another string.</p>

<p>In his search for a witch-wife he would not have
been justified in interfering at all with the clairvoyants
had it not been for the fact that they mix a little witchcraft
with their regular business. Their ostensible trade
is to diagnose and prescribe for different varieties of
internal disease, and so this particular branch of humbug
would not have come within the scope of the
voyager’s investigations, were it not that several of
these practitioners advertise to “tell the past, present,
and future, describe the future husband or wife, mark
out correctly the exact course of future life, give
unerring advice about business, absent friends, etc.”</p>

<p>All this had too strong a savor of witchcraft to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
ignored, and accordingly Johannes set forth on his
journey to visit another of these mysteriously clear-sighted
persons, keeping in view all the time the
probabilities of her being an A 1 spiritual medium,
and the very person whose aid would be invaluable
in his new journalistic enterprise.</p>

<p>Mrs. Seymour, of No. 110 Spring Street, was the
person towards whose house the Cash Customer bent
his steps, after reading the subjoined advertisement
of her powers and capabilities.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Clairvoyance.</span>—<span class="smcap">Mrs. Seymour</span>, 110 Spring Street, a few
doors west of Broadway, the most successful medical and business
Clairvoyant in America. All diseases discovered and cured, if
curable; unerring advice on business, absent friends, &amp;c., and
satisfaction in all cases, or no charge made.”</p></div>

<p>The clairvoyant branch of the fortune-telling business
seems to require a certain amount of respectability
in its practices, and they sneer at the
grosser deceptions of the more vulgar of the necromantic
trade. They keep aloof from the greasier
sisters of the profession, and they feel it due to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
dignity of their station to reject the cards, the magic
mirrors, the Bibles and keys, the mysterious pebbles
and the other tricks which do well enough for twenty-five
cent customers; to sojourn in reputable streets,
in respectable houses, and to have clean faces when
visitors come in. There are, it is true, clairvoyants
in the city who live wretchedly in miserable cellars,
whose garments and very hair are populated with
various specimens of animated nature, and whose
bodies are so filthy that the beholder wonders why
the spirits, which are so often disconnected from them
and sent on far-off missions, do not avail themselves
of the leave of absence to desert for ever such unsavory
corporeal habitations. But the majority of these
persons prefer parlors to basements, and make up the
difference in expenses by double-charging their customers.
Many of them, as before stated, combine a little
spiritualism of the other sort with the clairvoyance,
and they can all go into a trance on short notice
and rhapsodize with all the fervor if not the eloquence
of Mrs. Cora Hatch; they can all do the table-tipping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
trick, and are up to more rappings than the Rochester
Fox girls ever thought of. For these several reasons
therefore Mrs. Seymour would be a wife worth
having, or at least so thought Johannes as he pondered
these truths, and arranged in his mind his plan
of attack on the affections of that susceptible lady.</p>

<p>The house No. 110 Spring Street, occupied by Mrs.
Seymour for business purposes, is not more seedy in
appearance than the majority of half-way decent
tenant houses, which all have a decrepit look after
they are four or five years old, as though youthful dissipations
had made them weak in the joints. From
appearances, Mrs. Seymour’s house had been more
than commonly rakish in its juvenility, but it still
had that look of better days departed, which, in the
human kind, is peculiar to decayed ministers of the
gospel. It is a house where a man on a small salary
would apply for cheap board. Hither the inquirer
repaired, and shamefacedly knocked at the door, and
was admitted by a frowzy, coarse, plump, semi-respectable
girl, who would have been the better for a washing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
She opened the door and the customer entered
the reception-room, and had ample time before the
appearance of the mistress to take an observation.</p>

<p>The parlor was neatly, though rather scantily furnished,
with a rigid economy in the article of chairs.
The apartment communicated by folding-doors with
another room, whence could be heard an iron noise as
of some one scraping a saucepan with a kitchen-spoon.
The frowzy girl disappeared into this retired spot, and
in about the space of time that would be occupied by
an enterprising woman in rolling down her sleeves,
taking off her apron, and washing her hands, the
door opened, and Mrs. Seymour presented herself.</p>

<p>She was a frigid-looking woman, of about 35 years
of age, with dark hair and eyes, projecting lips and
heavy chin, and was of medium height and size. Her
appearance was perhaps lady-like, her movements
slow and well considered. She was perfectly self-possessed
and calculating, and appeared to cherish no
dissatisfaction with herself. Her demeanor, on the
whole, was repelling and chilly, and impressed her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
visitor very much as if some one had slipped a lump
of ice down his back and made him sit on it till it
melted.</p>

<p>She regarded him with a look of professional suspicion,
cast her eye round the room with a quick
glance, which instantly inventoried everything therein
contained, as though to assure herself of the safety of
any small articles which might be scattered about,
and then seated herself with an air of preparedness,
as if she was perfectly on guard and not to be taken
by surprise by anything that might occur. She
volunteered a frozen remark or two about the state
of the weather, and then subsided into silence, evidently
waiting to hear the object of the visit.</p>

<p>Her appearance and demeanor had instantly frozen
out of the voyager’s mind all thoughts of marriage;
he would as soon have wedded an iceberg, or have
taken to his heart of hearts a thermometer with its
mercury frozen solid. All he could do was to buy a
dollar’s worth of her clairvoyance and then get out.</p>

<p>As soon therefore as the first chill had passed off,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and he had thawed out a few words for immediate use
he asked for a little of that commodity.</p>

<p>When as he announced that he desired to know
about the present well or ill of some absent friends,
and that clairvoyance was the branch of her business
which would on this occasion be called into requisition,
she rose from her seat, walked to the door, never
taking her eyes from the hands and pockets of her
customer, and called to some one to come in. In
obedience to the summons, the frowzy girl entered;
this latter individual, since her first appearance, had
taken off her apron and pinned some kind of a collar
around her neck, but had not yet found time to comb
her hair, which was exceedingly demonstrative, and
forced itself upon attention.</p>

<p>Mrs. Seymour seated herself in a rocking-chair and
closed her eyes; the plump girl stood behind her and
pressed her thumbs firmly upon the temples of Mrs.
S. for about two minutes, during which time this latter
lady lost every instant something of life and animation,
until at last she froze up entirely. Then the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
frowzy girl made one or two mysterious mesmeric
passes over the sleeping beauty from her head to her
feet, to fix her in the iceberg state; then placing the
hand of Mrs. S. in the palm of the customer, she
left the room.</p>

<p>The worst of it was that Mrs. Seymour’s hand is
not an agreeable one to hold; it is cold and flabby, and
not suggestive of vitality. Her face, too, had become
pallid and corpse-like, and her thin blue lips were not
pleasant to regard. Johannes was puzzled; he didn’t
know what to do with the flabby hand, and how he
was to get any information about absent friends from
a fast-asleep woman he did not, as yet, exactly comprehend.
At this juncture, the lips asked, “Where
am I to go to?” The sitter suppressed a sulphurous
reply, and substituted, “To Minnesota.” Thereupon,
without any more definite direction as to what part
of that rather extensive territory she was expected to
visit, she sent her spirit off, and immediately uttered
these words:</p>

<p>“I see two old people, two <i>very</i> old people—one is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
a man and one is a woman; one of them has been
very sick of bilious fever, but is now better, and will
soon be quite well again. I can’t tell exactly how
these people look except that they are very old and
both are very grey. They may be husband and wife.
I think they are. They are both sitting down now.
I also see two young people—one of them is a male
and the other a female. The male I do not perceive
very plainly, and I cannot make out much about him;
he seems to be standing up and looking very sad, but
I can’t tell you a great deal about him. The female
I can see much better, and can make out more about.
She is tall, and has dark hair. She appears to be
connected in some way to the old people, but I do not
think she is related to the young man, though I cannot
exactly make out. She is a very agreeable-looking
female, rather pretty, I should say, if not positively
handsome. She has straight hair and does not
wear curls. She is standing up now, and appears to
be talking to the young man, who has his back partly
turned toward her. I don’t quite make out what they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
are saying. She has had a very severe attack of sickness,
but has nearly or quite recovered. She is not,
however, what I should call a healthy female, and she
will soon have another fit of sickness, which will be
worse than the first, and will bring her very low indeed—very
near to death. But she will not die then, though
she is not what I should call a long-lived person.
She will certainly die in six or eight years. What
disease she will die of I can’t just make out, but it
will not be of a lingering character: it will carry her
off suddenly. These people are all very anxious
about you, as if you was one of their family. They
have not heard from you lately, and are looking daily
for intelligence from you. They have written to you
twice within three months. One of the letters got to
this city—a man took it out of the mail. I don’t
know where he took it out, and I can’t exactly
describe the man, but a man took it out of the mail.
These people are not satisfied to live where they are
now; they are discontented with the country, and
will return here in the Spring. They are talking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
about it now. They would like to come back this
Winter, but circumstances are so that they cannot.
You may be sure, however, that you will see them
here in the Spring. There is no doubt of it; they
will come here in the Spring. The other letter that I
told you of that they had written has got here safe,
and is now in the Post-Office. You will find it there
if you inquire; you will be sure to get it as soon as
you go down to the office.”</p>

<p>This was delivered in a very jerky manner, with
occasional twitchings of the face and violent claspings
of the hand, which her visitor retained, although it
gave him a cold sweat to do it. Johannes, who has
friends in Minnesota, and whose questions were therefore
all in good faith, tried to get the sleeping female
to descend a little more to particulars, to describe individuals
or localities minutely enough to be recognised
if the descriptions approached the truth; but Mrs.
Seymour was not to be caught in this manner. She
invariably dodged the question, and dealt only in the
most vague and uncertain generalities—giving no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
description of persons or things that might not have
applied with equal accuracy to a hundred other persons
or things in that or any other locality. Her
assertions concerning the persons supposed to be her
customer’s friends did not approach the truth in any
one particular; nor was there the slightest shadow of
even probability in any single statement she uttered.
She is not, however, a woman to lack customers, so
long as there remain in the world fools of either sex.</p>

<p>When the inquirer had concluded his questioning,
he was somewhat at a loss how to awake the woman
from her trance, but she solved that little difficulty
herself by opening her eyes (as if she had been wide
awake all the time) and calling for the beauteous
maiden of the snarly hair, who accordingly appeared
and made a few mysterious mesmeric passes lengthwise
of her sleeping mistress, and awoke her to the
necessity of dunning her visitor, which she did
instantly and with a relish. He paid the demanded
dollar and departed.</p>

<hr />

<h3>MADAME CARZO, THE BRAZILIAN ASTROLOGIST,
No. 151 BOWERY.</h3>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> illustrious lady who is the subject of the present
chapter, came to the city of New York in 1856, and at
once took lodgings and began business in the fortune-telling
way. She did well, pecuniarily speaking, for
a time, but the details of a visit to her having been
published at length in one of the daily journals, she
at once retired from the business, and subsided into
private life. She is not now extant as a witch, and it
is not impossible that she is earning an honester living
in other ways.</p>

<p>The newspaper article that convinced her of the
error of her ways, and induced her to give up fortune-telling,
is the subjoined chapter by the “Individual:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>”</p>


<h4>He meets a Yankee-Brazilian. She is not ill-looking, etc.</h4>

<p>Whether the budding beauties of maidenhood are
inconsistent with the orgies of witchcraft; whether
there be an irreconcilable antagonism between youth
and loveliness, and the unknown mysteries of the black
art, is a vexed question of some interest. Can’t a
woman be supposed to indulge in a little devilment
before her hair turns grey, and her teeth fall out? and
is it impossible for her to have reliable and trustworthy
dealings with Old Scratch until she is wrinkled and
withered?</p>

<p>That’s what I want to know.</p>

<p>And I am very naturally urged to the inquiry by the
observation that every professional witch in New York
calls herself a “Madame.” There is not a “Miss” or a
“Mademoiselle,” in the whole batch. They all make
a pretence of being widows, or wives at the very least,
as if a certain amount of matrimonial tribulation was
indispensable to their accomplishment in the arts of
sorcery and magic. The only exception to this rule is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
found in the person of a female calling herself “The
Gipsy Girl,” who is otherwheres mentioned, and in
<i>her</i> case the several agencies of nature, rum, and small-pox
have made her so strikingly ugly that old age
could not add a single other trait of repulsiveness to
her excruciating features.</p>

<p>Now this is all a sad mistake. Let some young and
undeniably pretty girl go into the business, and she’d
soon get a run of exclusive customers who would stand
any price and pay without grumbling. If the original
Satan should refuse to recognise her eligibility, and
should decline to furnish her with the requisite quantity
of diabolic knowledge to set her up in business, she
could easily find an opposition devil who would provide
her stock in trade, and possibly at something less than
the usual rates. I’ll be bound that Lucifer doesn’t
monopolize the whole trade in witchcraft, and pocket
all the profits himself; for if some of the numerous
clerks in his employ haven’t yet learned the trick of
stealing the stock and selling it at a reduced price,
then the young gentlemen of our earthly mercantile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
houses are a good deal up-to-snuffer than the virtuous
demons of Mr. Satan’s establishment. This last-named
dealer generally demands the soul of the contracting
party in return for the powers and privileges conferred;
and in very many cases he must get decidedly the worst
of the bargain, for some of his precious adopted children
never had soul enough to pay for the ink to sign it
away with; but there is no doubt, in case a brisk
competition should arise for customers, that some of
his cashiers and head-clerks would contrive to under-sell
him even at this price.</p>

<p>The person who is so very anxious to effect this
desirable consummation, and to bring on a crop of
young and pretty witches to supersede the grizzled
ones of this present generation was Johannes, who had
of late been getting rather sick of the “Madames,” and
would prefer, if possible, to have the rest of his fortunes
told by ladies of tenderer age, and greater inexperience
in the ways of the world.</p>

<p>However, he was not the man to be deterred, in his
pursuit of wisdom, by the age and ugliness, grey hairs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
wrinkles, false teeth, <i>no</i> teeth, dirt, ignorance, and
imbecility he had encountered, and he was determined
to go on to the very end and see if these are the sum
total of modern witchcraft.</p>

<p>And then <i>duns</i> came o’er the spirit of his dream,
and fond visions of sundry small debts, paid by magic
and a wife, as soon as he should succeed in finding the
wife who had the magic, floated across his hard-up
brain, and encouraged him to perseverance in his
matrimonial quest. And when he had won that
invaluable lady, he would stuff his mattress with
receipted bills, and cram his pillow with cancelled
notes, lie down to pleasant dreams, and awake to
ready cash.</p>

<p>Sweet thought!</p>

<p>So he made ready to visit the humble abode of
<span class="smcap">Madame Carzo, the Brazilian Astrologist</span>,
<i>No. 151 Bowery</i>.</p>

<p>To say that he discovered, in this lady, the ideal of
his search, that he found her handsome, intelligent,
learned in the stars and thoroughly posted in the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
branches of her trade, would be to anticipate. Suffice
to say that boa-constrictors, half-naked savages, dye-woods,
Jesuit’s bark, cockatoos, scorpions and ring-tailed
monkeys, are not, as he had hitherto supposed,
the only contributions to the happiness of mankind
afforded by South America, for the Province of
Brazil grows fortune-tellers of a very superior quality
as to respectability and neatness of appearance. A
Brazilian witch was something new, and without
stopping to inquire how she had strayed so far away
from home, he immediately argued that that single
fact was decidedly in her favor. Thus ran the logic:</p>

<p>If there be any diabolism in modern witchcraft, the
practisers thereof who have received their education
in tropical latitudes ought to be the most worthy of
credence and belief, inasmuch as the temperature of
their places of residence seems to afford a supposition
that they live nearer head-quarters, and are, therefore,
most likely to receive information by the shortest
routes.</p>

<p>By the time he arrived at the spot where the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
astrologist condescended to abide, he had, by this
course of reasoning, convinced himself that he ought
to place implicit confidence in any revelations of the
future made by the mysterious woman who advertised
herself and her calling, daily in the papers as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Madame Carzo</span>, the gifted Brazilian Astrologist, tells the
fate of every person who visits her with wonderful accuracy,
about love, marriage, business, property, losses, things stolen,
luck in lotteries, absent friends, at No. 151 Bowery, corner of
Broome.”</p></div>

<p>The South American lady had located her mysterious
self in a fragrant spot.</p>

<p>The corner of Bowery and Broome Street and
vicinity seems to have some kind of a constitutional
disorder, and it relieves itself by a cutaneous eruption
of low rum shops and pustulous beer saloons, which
always look as if they ought to be squeezed and
rubbed with ointment of red lead. To an observing
person it appears as if the city wanted to scratch itself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
in that particular part to relieve the local irritation,
and then ought, for the sake of its general health, to
take a large dose of brimstone immediately afterward.
The liquors sold at these places are those pure and
healthful beverages, “warranted to kill at forty rods,”
and are the very drinks with which a convivial, but
revengeful man, would wish to regale his friend
against whom he held a secret grudge. Why
Madame Carzo had chosen this particular locality,
does not appear; perhaps because the liquor was
cheap and the rent low. Certain it is that there she
sat, at a window overlooking the Bowery, in full
view of all the pedestrians in the street and the passengers
in the 4th Avenue Railroad.</p>

<p>Madame Carzo was, doubtless, deeply attached to
her old Brazilian home, and loved to surround
herself with circumstances and things that would
constantly and vividly recall pleasant memories of her
southern country. Cherishing, probably, kindly and
regretful remembrances of the harmless reptiles of
her own Brazilian forests, she had taken up her abode<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
in the very thick of the Bowery bar-rooms, as the
only things afforded by our frigid climate, at all
approaching in life-destroying malignity the speedier
venoms to which she had been accustomed in her
delightful southern home. First-rate facilities for
drugging a man into a state of crazy madness are
offered at the bar across the way; he may swill himself
into a condition of beastly stupidity with lager
beer from next door below; he may be pleasantly
poisoned by degrees with the drugged alcohol, in
various forms, which is sold next door above; or he
may be more speedily disposed of with a couple of
doses of “doctored” whiskey from the festering den
just round the corner. Lucrezia Borgia was a
novice, a mere babe in toxicology. New York
wholesale liquor dealers could teach her the alphabet
in the fine art of slow poisoning. She would no
longer need the subtle chemistry of the Borgias; she
could learn of them to poison wholesale and to do the
work by labor-saving machinery.</p>

<p>Johannes, resolved that if he should marry the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
astrologist he would move out of the neighborhood,
and take a house in a cleaner part of the city,
for he felt that if he had to do even the courting here,
he would have to fumigate himself after every visit
to his lady-love as though he had just come out of a
yellow-fever ship. He knew that if he should chance
to meet the Health Officer in the street after a two
hours’ stay in that locality, that trusty official would,
from the unhealthy smell of his coat, quarantine him
for forty days, and put him up to his neck in a barrel
of chloride of lime every morning.</p>

<p>But a full-fledged Cupid is a plucky animal, and
not easily killed by anything no more tangible than
smell, and the particular Cupid that had possession
of the voyager’s heart came of a long-suffering breed,
and was equal to almost any emergency. So as
Johannes did not feel his ardent passion die, or even
turn sick at the stomach, he thought he could manage
to get through. If he couldn’t get along any
other way, he could fill his pockets with brimstone
matches, and his boots full of blue vitriol. Or he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
could carry a bunch of Chinese fire-crackers in his
hat, and touch them off on the sly whenever he felt
himself in need of a healthy smell. Then he could
wash himself all over in lime-water, and drink a quart
or so of some liquid disinfectant every time he came
away. So he went ahead.</p>

<p>Madame Carzo, the Brazilian interpreter of Yankee
fate and fortunes, lives in the third story of the house
No. 151 Bowery, with her sister, a girl of about
fifteen years of age. The two occupy themselves
with plain sewing, except when the Madame is overhauling
the future and taking a look at the hereafter
of some anxious inquirer, who pays her as much for
the reliable information she imparts in three minutes,
as she would charge him for making three shirts.
The inquirer gave his customary modest ring at the
door, and was admitted with as little question as if he
had been the taxes, the Croton water, or the gas. Up
the two flights of stairs walked the gentleman in the
pursuit of witchcraft, gave a bashful knock at the
door, at the side of which was painted, on a small bit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of pasteboard, “Madame Carzo”—repented of his
temerity before the echo of the knock had died away,
but was admitted into the room before his repentance
had time to develop itself into running away.</p>

<p>A shabby-looking girl, with her hair in as much
confusion as if the city had contracted to keep it
straight, with one ear-ring in her ear, and the other
on the table, with her shoes down at the heel, her
dress unhooked behind, and her breast-pin wrong side
up, was the model young woman who had answered
the knock. She had evidently been engaged in an
animated single combat with another young woman,
of about the same quality and age, who was seated on
a low stool in the corner, for she instantly renewed
hostilities by stabbing her antagonist in the arm with
a needle, tapping her on the head with a thimble, and
kicking her pin-cushion under the table, so she could
not recover it without crawling on her hands and
knees.</p>

<p>On a small sofa or lounge at the side of the room
was a quantity of what ladies call “work,” thrown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
down in a great hurry, with the needle yet sticking in
it, and the scissors, and the beeswax, and the measuring
tape, and the bodkin half-concealed inside, as if
the knock at the door had startled the needle-woman,
and she had flown to parts unknown. It was
undoubtedly Madame Carzo herself who had so unceremoniously
deserted her colors and her weapons, and
Johannes looked at the needle with veneration,
viewed the thimble with respect, and regarded the
beeswax and the bodkin with concentrated awe.</p>

<p>A small cooking-stove was in the side of the room,
and immediately over it was a picture of St. Andrew
in such a position that he could smell all the dinners;
a number of other pictures of Roman Catholic subjects
were neatly framed and hanging against the
wall. St. Somebody taking his ease on an X-shaped
cross, St. Somebody Else comfortably cooking on a
gridiron, and St. Somebody, different from either of
these, impaled on a spear like a bug in an Entomological
Museum. There was also an atrocious colored
print labelled “Millard Fillmore,” which, if it at all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
resembled that venerated gentleman, must have been
taken when he had the measles, complicated with
the mumps and toothache, and was attired in a sky-blue
coat, a red cravat, yellow vest, and butternut-colored
pantaloons.</p>

<p>The room was neatly furnished with carpet, table,
chairs, cheap mirror, and a lounge. While the visitor
was taking this observation, the two young ladies
before mentioned had continued to spar after a feminine
fashion, and had finished about three rounds;
the model, who had answered the bell, had got the
other one, who was black-haired and vicious, under
the table, and was following up her advantage by
sticking a bodkin into the tender places on her feet
and ancles. When the model had at length thoroughly
subjugated and subdued the black-haired one, and
reduced her to a state of passive misery, she turned to
her visitor with an amiable smile, and asked him if
he desired to see the Madame. Receiving an affirmative
reply, she gave a sly kick to her fallen foe, stepped
on her toes under pretence of moving away a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
chair, and then disappeared into another room to
inform Madame Carzo that visitors and dollars were
awaiting her respectful consideration in the anteroom.</p>

<p>The “gifted Brazilian astrologist” regarded the
suggestion with a favorable eye, for the model soon
reappeared and showed the searcher after hidden
knowledge into a bedroom nearly dark, wherein
were several dresses hanging on the wall, a bed, two
chairs, a table, and Madame Carzo. The light was so
arranged as to fall directly in the face of the stranger,
while the countenance of the Madame was, to a certain
extent, hidden in shadow.</p>

<p>Johannes, nevertheless, in spite of this disadvantage,
by careful observation, is enabled to give a
tolerably accurate description of Madame Carzo, as
follows: She is a tall, comely-looking woman, with
unusually large black eyes, clear complexion, dark
hair worn <i>à la Jenny Lind</i>, a small hand, clean, and
with the nails trimmed, and she has a low sweet
voice. Her dress was lady-like, being a neat half-mourning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
plaid, with a plain linen collar at the neck,
turned smoothly over; altogether, Madame Carzo,
the Brazilian astrologist, who speaks without a
symptom of foreign accent, impressed her customer as
being a transplanted Yankee school ma’am, with
shrewdness enough to see that while civilization and
enlightenment would only pay her twenty dollars a
month, and superstition and ignorance would give her
twice that sum in a week, she couldn’t, of course,
afford to live in a civilized and enlightened neighborhood,
and depend exclusively on civilization and
enlightenment for a living.</p>

<p>And Johannes was smitten, he had found her, and
if his fortune was propitious he would yet win and
wed the Brazilian astrologist, and she should have
the honor of paying his debt, and earning his bread
and butter. But he would make no advances yet for
fear of accidents; he would not commit himself until
he had called upon the rest of the witches on his list,
to see, if perchance, he might not find one more
eligible. If not, then by all means Madame Carzo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
should be the chosen one. The first thing evidently
was to ascertain her proficiency in the magic
arts.</p>

<p>The sorceress and the anxious inquirer seated
themselves face to face, and the following dialogue
ensued: “Do you wish to consult me, Sir?” “Yes.”</p>

<p>“My terms are a dollar for gentlemen.”</p>

<p>The expected dollar was handed over, when the
’cute Yankeeism of the Brazilian lady blazed out
brilliantly, for she instantly produced a “Thompson’s
Bank-note Detector” from under a pillow, and a one
dollar note, issued by the President and Directors of
the “Quinnipiack Bank” of Connecticut, underwent
a severe scrutiny. At last the genuineness of the bill
and the solvency of the bank were certified to the
Madame’s satisfaction, in his oracular pamphlet,
by Thompson with a “p,” and Madame Carzo was
evidently satisfied that her customer didn’t mean to
swindle her, but was good for small debts not exceeding
one dollar each. Accordingly she took his left
hand, regarded it for some time, apparently delighted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
with its model symmetry, but at last so far conquered
her silent admiration as to speak and say:</p>

<p>“You were born under two planets, Moon and
Mars, Moon brings you a great deal of trouble in the
early part of your life. Moon has occasioned a great
deal of anxiety to your parents on your account.
Moon made you liable to accidents and misfortunes
while you was a boy, and Moon will give you great
trouble until you arrive at middle age. You were
born, I should say, across the water, and you will die
across the water in a city, but not a great city. You
are, I should say, now far away from that city, and
from your home, and parents, and friends, who are, I
should say, all now far across the water. You will
be sure, however, I should say, for to see them all
before you die, and to die in the city that I told you
of. Your line of life runs to 60; you will, I should
say, live to be 60, but not much after. Moon will
cause you much trouble for many years, but you will
be certain for to succeed well in the end, I should
say. You will be certain for to have final success<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and to conquer every obstacle, in spite of Moon, I
should say.”</p>

<p>Incensed as was Johannes at Moon for thus unjustifiably
interfering with his prospects and meddling
with his private affairs, he still admired the more the
profitable science of the wonderful lady whose
acquirements in magic had given her so intimate an
acquaintance with Moon, as to enable her to tell so
exactly the plans and intentions of that unruly and
adverse planet.</p>

<p>He mastered his indignation and listened attentively
to the sequel.</p>

<p>On the small stand were two packs of cards of
different sizes, and a volume of Byron. Madame
Carzo took up one pack of the cards, presented them
to the young man, waited for them to be cut three
times, after which she said:</p>

<p>“You face up a good fortune I should say, you
have had trouble but can now, I should say, see the
end of it—you face up money, which is coming to you
from over the water, I should say, and you will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
sure for to get it before a great while. You will
never have much money from relations or friends,
though you will, I should say, perhaps have some—but
though you will handle a great deal of money in
your lifetime you will make the most of it yourself,
I should say—you will not, however, I should say,
ever be able for to become very rich, for you will
never be able for to keep money, although you will
have the handling of a great deal in your life. No, I
am certain that you will never be rich.”</p>

<p>Here Johannes remembered the malicious influence
of Moon upon his fortunes, and as he clinched his
fists, felt as if he would like to get at the man who
resides in that ill-conditioned planet, and have a back-hold
wrestle with him on stony ground.</p>

<p>But the astrologist continued thus: “You face up
a letter; you also face up good news which is to come
speedily I should say; you don’t face up a sick bed,
or a coffin, or a funeral, or any kind of immediate bad
luck that I am able to see. You face up two men,
one dark and one light complexioned. You must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
beware of the dark-complexioned man, for I should say
he will do you an injury if you allow him for to have
a chance. You like to study: the kind of business
you would do best in is <i>doctor</i>. You face up a light-complexioned
lady; you will, I should say, be able
to marry this lady, though a dark-complexioned man
stands in the way. You must, I should say, be particularly
careful to beware of the dark-complexioned
man. You will be married twice; your first wife
will die, but your last wife, I should say, will be
likely for to outlive you. You will have three
children, which will be all, I should say, that you will
be likely for to have.”</p>

<p>And this was all for the present, except that she
told her visitor that he might draw thirteen cards,
and make a wish, which he did, and she, on carefully
examining the cards, told him that he would certainly
have his wish.</p>

<p>Cheered by this last grateful promise, and bidding
a mental defiance to Moon, the traveller left the room.
In the reception chamber he found the model and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
black-eyed one just coming to time for what he should
judge was the twenty-seventh round, both much
damaged in the hair, but plucky to the last.</p>

<p>Johannes walked briskly away, feeling that his
matrimonial prospects were brighter now than for
many a day, and fully determined that if, on going
further he fared worse, he would certainly retrace his
steps and wed Madame Carzo off-hand.</p>

<hr />

<h3>MADAME LEANDER LENT, No. 163 MULBERRY
STREET.</h3>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">I have</span> before suggested, in as plain terms as the
peculiar nature of the subject will allow, that these
fortune-telling women, having most of them been
prostitutes in their younger days, in their withered
age become professional procuresses, and make a
trade of the betrayal of innocence into the power
of Lust and Lechery. This assertion is so eminently
probable that few will be inclined to dispute it,
but I wish to be understood that this is no matter
of mere surmise with me—it is a proven fact. And
the evidences of its truth have been gathered, not
alone from the formal and hurried records of the
police courts, but from the lips of certain inmates
of various Magdalen Asylums who have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
reclaimed from their former homes of shame; and from
the mouths of other repentant women, who, under circumstances
where there was no object to deceive, and
at times when their hearts were full of grateful love
for those who had interposed to save them from utter
despair, have in all simple truthfulness and honor,
related their life-histories. It is impossible to give
even a plausible guess at the aggregate number
of young women, in this great city, who compromise
their honorable reputations in the course of a
single year; but of those whose shame becomes publicly
known, and especially of those who eventually
enter houses of ill-repute, the percentage whose fall
was accomplished through the instrumentality, more
or less direct, of the professional fortune-tellers, is
astounding. And a curious fact connected with this
subject is, that of these unfortunates who thus wander
astray, not one in ten but has ever after the most
superstitious and implicit faith in the supernatural
powers of the witch. Each one sees in her own case
certain things that have been foretold to her by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
fortune-teller with such circumstantiality of time
and place, and which have afterwards “come to
pass,” so exactly in accordance with the prophecy,
that she can only account for it by ascribing supernatural
prescience to the prophetess.</p>

<p>The true solution of the matter is, of course, that
the wonderful fulfilments are achieved by means of
confederacy and collusion with parties with whom the
dupe is never brought in contact; a common <i>modus
operandi</i> of this sort is elsewhere described.</p>

<p>Nor are the fortune-tellers and the brothel-keepers
by any means content with playing into each
other’s hands in a general sort of way; there are, in
New York, several <i>firms</i>, consisting each of a fortune-teller
and a mistress of a bawdy-house, who have
entered into a perfectly organized business partnership,
and who ply their fearful trade with as much
zeal and enthusiasm as is ever exhibited in the active
competition between rival commercial houses engaged
in legitimate trade.</p>

<p>Although this fact is one that cannot be substantiated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
by the production of any sworn documents, it
is as well proven by the observations of keen-eyed
detectives attached to the police department, and to
some of the charitable institutions of this city, as though
attested articles of co-partnership could be exhibited
with the signatures of the contracting parties attached
thereto. A gentleman of this city, in whose word I
have the most perfect confidence, tells me that he
once, by a curious accident, overheard a business consultation
between the two members of such a firm;
and that such partnerships <i>do</i> exist, and that by their
means hundreds of ignorant young women, of the
lower classes, are every year betrayed to their moral
ruin, I no more doubt than I doubt the rotundity of
the earth.</p>

<p>If the illustrious woman who is the subject of the
present chapter should ever surmise that the foregoing
observations are intended to have a personal application
to herself, the author will give her much more
credit for sagacity and discernment than he did for
supernatural wisdom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame Leander Lent is one of the most shrewd,
unscrupulous, and dirty of all the goodly sisterhood
of New York witches. She has so great a run of
customers that her doors are often besieged by
anxious inquirers as early as eight o’clock in the
morning, and the servant is frequently puzzled to find
room and chairs to accommodate the shame-faced
throng, till her ladyship sees fit to get out of bed and
begin the labors of the day. She is then impartial
in the distribution of her favors; the audiences are
governed by barber-shop rules, and the visitors are
admitted to the presence in the order of their coming,
and any one going out forfeits his or her “turn” and
on returning must take position at the tail end of the
queue.</p>

<p>The Fates show no favoritism.</p>

<p>The quarter in which Madame Lent has domiciled
herself and her familiars, is by no means in the most
aristocratic part of the city. “Mulberry,” is the
pomological name of the street, and it has never been
celebrated for its cleanliness or for its eligibility as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
site for princely mansions. In fact it has been, on the
whole, rather neglected by that class of society who
generally indulge in palatial luxuries.</p>

<p>Hercules, in his capacity of an amateur scavenger,
once attempted the cleaning of the Augean stables, or
some such trifle, and his success was trumpeted
throughout the neighborhood as a triumph of ingenuity
and perseverance. If Hercules would come to
Gotham and try his hand at the purgation of Mulberry
Street, our word for it, he would, in less than a
week, knock out his brains with his own club in utter
despair.</p>

<p>There never yet were swine with stomachs strong
enough to feed upon the garbage of its gutters,
or with instincts so perverted as to wallow in its filth.
Dogs, lean and wild-eyed, the outcasts of the canine
world, sometimes, driven by sore stress of hunger,
sneak here with drooping tails and shame-faced looks,
to search for bones, and then, wounded in their self-respect
by the very act, they drag their osseous provender
to a distance, and upon some sunny mud-heap,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
dine in dainty neatness. The very pavement is
broken into countless hillocks and ruts like waves, as
if, in utter disgust at the place and its associations,
the street was trying to roll itself away in stony billows.
The shattered wrecks of worn-out drays and
carts stand forsaken in the street, keeping each other
dismal company, while an occasional shackly wheelbarrow
makes the place look as though, after some
monstrous fashion, it were a lying-in hospital for
poverty-stricken vehicles, and the wheelbarrows were
the new-born children, decrepit even in their babyhood.
The houses in this pleasant vale have a disheartened
tumble-down look, and give the impression
of having been originally built by apprentices out of
second-hand material. They lean maliciously over
the narrow sidewalks, and keep up a constant
threatening of a sudden collapse and a general smash
of passers-by. If the houses are not dirtier than the
street, it is only because every possible element of filth
enters into the latter; if they are not dirtier inside than
outside, it is because superlatives have no superlative.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Pawnbrokers’ shops are plentiful, kept always by
sharp-featured restless Jews, who watch for unwary
passers-by like unclean beasts crouching in noisome,
dangerous lairs; while bar-rooms yawn in frequent
cellars to devour bodily the victims the Jews only rob.</p>

<p>In this, one of the dirtiest streets in this dirty
metropolis, directly opposite the English Lutheran
Church of St. James, in one of the dirtiest tenant-houses
in the street, abideth Madame Leander Lent,
the prophetess. Why the mysterious powers didn’t
select an earthly representative with a more reputable
dwelling-place is a mystery; but there seems to
be an inseparable congeniality between prophetic
knowledge and concentrated nastiness, utterly beyond
all power of explanation. The Madame advises the
public of her business in the terms following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Astrology.</span>—Madame <span class="smcap">Leander Lent</span> can be consulted about
love, marriage, and absent friends; she tells all the events of life
at No. 169 Mulberry-st., first floor, back room. Ladies 25
cents; gents 50 cents. She causes speedy marriage. Charge
extra.”</p></div>

<p>Her customers are much more addicted to love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
than marriage, so that the wedlock clause cannot
be relied on to bring many fish to the net, but it is
supposed to give an air of respectability to the advertisement.</p>

<p>The Cash Customer was, perhaps, an exception to
this general rule, and feeling that he would on the
whole rather like a “speedy marriage,” and wouldn’t
so much mind the “extra charge,” he went, in cold
blood, with this matrimonial intent to the street, found
the number, and heroically entered the house in the
very face of a threatened unclean baptism from the
upper windows.</p>

<p>His timid knock at the door of the room was
answered by a sturdy “Come in,” from the inside;
hat deferentially in hand he modestly entered, and
was received by a fat woman with a bust of proportions
exceeding those of Mrs. Merdle in “Little
Dorrit,” and who was attired in a dress which may
have been clean in the earlier years of its history,
though the supposition is exceedingly apocryphal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
This lady pointed to a chair, and then composedly
seated herself and resumed her explorations with a
comb, in the hair of a vicious boy of about three
years old, the eldest scion of Madame Leander.</p>

<p>Her enthusiasm in the cause of entomological
science was too ardent to be quenched by the mere
presence of an observer, and she continued to hunt
her insect prey with all the ardor of a she-Nimrod,
and with a zeal that was rewarded by a brilliant success.
The youth, over whose fertile head the game
seemed to rove and range in countless numbers, was
somewhat restless under the operation, and oftentimes
disturbed the eager sportswoman by manifesting a
desire to run into the street and carry the hunting-ground
with him, and was as often recalled to a sense
of the proprieties by a few judicious slaps, which he
stoically endured without a whimper, being evidently
used to it.</p>

<p>This feminine lover of the chase, this Diana of the
fiery scalp, looked up from her occupations long
enough to say to her visitor that Madame Lent would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
soon be disengaged. Meantime, he made a careful
survey of the premises.</p>

<p>Two chairs, an old lounge with its dingy red cover
fastened on with pins, and a trunk covered with an
old bit of carpet, were the accommodations for seating
visitors. A cooking-stove, and a suspicious-looking
wash-bowl which stood in the corner of the room,
without a pitcher, were probably for the accommodation
of the Madame and the lady with the comb.
On the shabby lounge sat a stolid-looking Irish girl,
who was waiting her turn to have her fortune told.
Having fully comprehended the room and everything
in it, the visitor turned his attention to literary pursuits,
and thoroughly perused an odd copy of a newspaper
that lay invitingly on the table.</p>

<p>Visitors kept dropping in, mostly servant-appearing
girls, though there were three women attired in silk
and laces, who would have appeared respectable had
their faces been hidden and their conversation been
suppressed. The lady with the comb and the boy
presently departed to some unknown region, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
soon returned with a reinforcement of chairs and
stools. The number of visitors increased, until,
besides the original stranger, nine were waiting.
Among others, there came, in a friendly way, but
still with a sharp eye to business, a tall woman,
attired in a red dress and a purple bonnet, who is the
keeper of a well-known house in Sullivan street, and
whose name is not strange to the police. An unrestrained
business conversation ensued between her
and the heroine of the comb, which must have been
interesting to the female listeners.</p>

<p>One hour and eleven minutes did the Cash Customer
patiently wait before he was admitted to the
mysterious conference with the queen of magic. At
last, after the man who was at first closeted with her
had concluded his inquiries, and the stolid Irish girl
had been disposed of, the woman with the suggestive
bust beckoned the long-suffering and patient man to
follow, and he fearfully entered the sanctum.</p>

<p>The room of conjuration was a closet, dark and
dirty, and was lighted by one tallow candle, stuck in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
a Scotch ale bottle. A number of shabby dresses,
bony petticoats, and other mysterious articles of
women’s gear, hung upon the walls; two weak-kneed
chairs, a tattered bit of carpet upon about two
feet square of the floor, and a little table covered with
a greasy oilcloth, composed the furniture of the
mystic cell. The cabalistic paraphernalia was limited,
there being nothing but a dirty pack of double-headed
cards, a small pasteboard box with some
scraps of paper in it, and two kinds of powder in
little bottles, like hair-oil pots.</p>

<p>Madame Lent is a woman of medium height, about
thirty-five years of age, with light-grey eyes, false
teeth, a head nearly bald, and hair, what there is of
it, of a bright red. Her manner is hurried and confused,
and she has a trick of drawing her upper lip
disagreeably up under the end of her nose, which
labial distortion she doubtless intends for a smile.</p>

<p>She was robed in a bright-colored plaid dress, a
dirty lace collar, and a coarse woollen shawl over her
shoulders. Motioning her visitor to one chair, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
instantly seated herself in the other, and, without
demanding pay in advance, commenced operations.
She handed the cards to be cut, and then laying them
out in their piles, uttered the following sentences:</p>

<p>“I see that your fortune has been and is quite a
curious one. Your cards run rather mixed up, you
have been very much worried in your head, you were
born under two planets, which means that you have
seen a great deal of trouble in your younger days,
but you are now getting over it and your cards run
to better luck, but it is rather mixed up, your cards
run to a lady, she is light-haired and blue-eyed, but
she is jealous of you, for sometimes you treat her
more kinder and sometimes more harsher, and just
now she is in trouble and very much mixed up about
you. There is a man of black hair and eyes, a dark-<i>complected</i>
man who pretends to be your friend and
is very fair to your face, but you must beware of him,
for he is your secret enemy and will do you an injury
if he can; he is trying to get the lady, but I don’t
think he’ll do it, though I don’t know, for the thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
is so much mixed up—he has deceived you, and the
lady has deceived you, they have both deceived you,
but now they have got mixed up, and she turns from
him with scorn, and seems to like you the best—I
don’t exactly see how it all is, for it seems rather
mixed up like—you must persevere, you must coax
her more; you can coax her to do anything, but you
can’t drive her any more than you can drive that wall—always
treat her more kinder and never more
harsher, and she will soon be yours entirely—beware
of the dark-complected man; you must not talk so
much and be so open in your mind, and above all
don’t talk so much to the dark-complected man, for
he seems to worry you, and your affairs and his are
all mixed up like.”</p>

<p>Here her auditor expressed a desire to know something
definite and certain about his future wife,
whereupon the red-haired prophetess shuffled the
cards again with the following result:</p>

<p>“You will have but one more wife. She will be
good and true, and will not be mixed up with any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
dark-complected man. She will be rich and you will
be rich, for your business cards run very smooth, but
your marriage cards do not run very close to you,
and you will not be married for six or eight months;
you will have three children; you will see your future
wife within nine hours, nine days, or nine weeks; do
not blame me if it runs into the tens, but I tell you
it will fall within the nines. Another man is trying
to get her away from you, he is a light-complected
man, he has had some influence over her, but she
now turns from him with disdain, and she will be
yours and yours only—things are a little worried and
mixed up now, but she will be yours and yours only,
the light-complected man can’t hurt you. I have
something that I can give you that will make her
love you tender and true; it will force her to do it
and she won’t have no power to help herself, but you
can do with her just what you please; I charge extra
for that.”</p>

<p>Here was a chance to procure a love-philtre at a
reasonable rate, and unless the dark woman kept that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
article ready made and done up in packages to suit
customers, he could observe the terrible ceremonies
with which it was prepared, listen to the spells and
incantations with an attent eye, and take mental notes
of all the mighty magic. The opportunity was too
good to be lost, and he at once signified his desire to
try a little of the extra witchcraft, and his willingness
to draw on his purse for the requisite amount of
ready cash to purchase this gratification of a laudable
curiosity.</p>

<p>Madame Lent now assumed an air of the most
intense gravity, and shook into a very dirty bit of
paper a little white powder from one of the pomatum
pots, and a corresponding quantity of grayish powder
from pot No. 2, and stirred them carefully together
with the tip of her finger. When she had mixed
them to her liking she folded the diabolical compound
in a small paper. Then she prepared another
mixture in the same manner, and made a pretence of
adding another ingredient from a little pasteboard
box, which probably hadn’t had anything in it for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
month. Folding this also in a paper she presented
them both to her interested guest, with these directions:</p>

<p>“You must shake some of the first powder on your
true-love’s head, or neck, or arms, if you can, but if
you can’t manage this, put it on her dress—the other
powder you must sprinkle about your room when
you go to bed to-night—this will draw her to you, and
she will love you and you alone and can’t help herself;
this will surely operate, if it don’t, come and tell me.”</p>

<p>One more cabalistic performance and the hocus-pocus
was ended. She desired her customer to give
her the first letter of his true love’s name. He, unabashed
by the unexpected demand, with great presence
of mind promptly invented a sweetheart on the
spot, and extemporized a name for her before the
question was repeated. Then the mysterious Madame
required his own initial, which, being obtained, she
wrote the two on slips of paper with some mystic
figures appended, in manner following. E., 17; M.,
24. Then she shiveringly whispered:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“You must do as I told you with the powders
before eleven o’clock to-night, for between the hours
of eleven and twelve I shall boil your name and hers
in herbs which will draw her to you, and she can’t
help herself but will be tender and true, and will be
yours and yours only. When she is drawed to you
then you must marry her.”</p>

<p>The anxious inquirer promised obedience, and
agreed to give the powders as per prescription, before
the midnight cookery should commence, paid his dollar
(fifty cents for the consultation and a like sum for
the love-powders), and made his exit with a comprehensive
bow, which included the Madame, the bony
petticoats, the beer-bottle, and the fast-vanishing remains
of the single tallow-candle in one reverential
farewell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<hr />

<h3>Wherein are inscribed all the particulars of a visit to the<br />
“Gipsy Girl,” of No. 207, Third Avenue,<br />
with an allusion to Gin, and other luxuries<br />
dear to the heart of that beautiful<br />

<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER XII.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></h2>

<h3>THE GIPSY GIRL.</h3>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">There</span> is much less affectation of high-flown and
lofty-sounding names among the ladies of the black-art
mysteries, than might very naturally be expected.
Most of them are content with plain “Madame”
Smith, or unadorned “Mrs.” Jones, and “The Gipsy
Girl” is almost the only exception to this rule that is
to be encountered among all the fortune-tellers of the
city.</p>

<p>This arises from no poverty of invention on their
part, but from a sound conviction that in this case,
simplicity is an element of sound policy. There has
been no lack of “mysteriously gifted prophetesses,”
and of “astonishing star readers;” there have been, I
believe, within the last few years, a “Daughter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Saturn,” and a “Sorceress of the Silver Girdle;” and
once the “Queen of the Seven Mysteries” condescended
to sojourn in Gotham for five weeks, but on
the whole it has been found that a more modest title
pays better. To be sure, the “Daughter of Saturn”
was tried for conspiring with two other persons to
swindle an old and wealthy gentleman out of seventeen
hundred dollars, and the “Queen of the Seven
Mysteries” was dispossessed by a constable for non-payment
of rent; and these untoward circumstances
may have acted as a “modest quencher” on the then
growing disposition to indulge in fantastic and romantic
appellations.</p>

<p>At this present time “The Gipsy Girl” enjoys
almost a monopoly of this sort of thing, and she is by
no means constant to one name, but sometimes
announces herself as “The Gipsy Woman,” “The
Gipsy Palmist,” and “The Gipsy Wonder,” as her
whim changes.</p>

<p>This woman has not been in New York years
enough to become complicated in as many rascalities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
as some of her elder sisters in the mystic arts, but her
surroundings are of a nature to indicate that she has
not been backward in her American education on these
points. She has not been remarkably successful in
making money, as a witch; not having been educated
among the strumpets and gamblers of the city she
lacked that extensive acquaintance on going into business,
that had secured for her rivals in trade such
immediate success. Her fondness for gin has also
proved a serious bar to her rapid advancement, and
has given not a few of her customers the idea that she
is not so eminently trustworthy as one having the
control of the destinies of others should be. In fact,
she loves her enemy, the bottle, to that extent, that
she has many times permitted her devotion to it to
interfere seriously with her business, leading her to
disappoint customers. The quality of her sober predictions
is about the same as that of others in the
same profession, but her intoxicated foretellings are
deserving of a chapter to themselves, and they shall
have it, for from force of peculiar circumstances, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
will be explained hereafter, the Cash Customer made
three visits to this celebrated woman. Her first
address was 207 3d Avenue, between Eighteenth and
Nineteenth Streets.</p>

<p>The Gipsy Girl! How romantically suggestive was
this feminine phrase to the fancy of an enthusiastic reporter.
Was it then, indeed, permitted that he should
know Meg Merrilees in private life? His heart danced
at the poetic possibility, and his heels would have extemporized
a vigorous hornpipe but that his saltatory
ardor was quenched by the depressing sturdiness of
cow-hide boots. With the most pleasing anticipations
he perused the subjoined advertisement again and
again, and looked to the happy future with a joyful hope.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“A Wonder—The Gipsy Girl.—If you wish to know all the
secrets of your past and future life, the knowledge of which
may save you years of sorrow and care, don’t fail to consult the
above-named palmist. Charge 50 cents. The Gipsy has also
on hand a secret which will enable any lady or gentleman to
win or obtain the affections of the opposite sex. Charge extra.
No. 207 3d av., between 18th and 19th sts.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>How the knowledge of all the secrets of his past
life was to save him years of sorrow and care at this
late day he could not exactly comprehend, and was
willing to pay fifty cents for the information. And
then wasn’t it worth half a dollar to see a live gipsy?
Of course it was.</p>

<p>Kettles, camp-fires, white tents under green trees,
indigenous brown babies and exotic white ones, with
a panorama of empty cradles and mourning mothers
in the distance, moonlight nights, midnight foraging
excursions, expeditions against impertinent game-keepers,
demonstrations against hen-roosts—successful
by masterly generalship and pure strategic science—and
the midnight forest cookery of contraband game,
surreptitious pigs and clandestine chickens—were
among the romantic ideas of a delightful vagabond
gipsy life that at once suggested themselves to the
mind of the Cash Customer. He did not really expect
to find the Third-Avenue gipsy camped out under a
bed-quilt tent in the lee of the house, or cooking her
dinner in an iron pot over an out-door fire in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
back yard, but he had a vague undefined hope that
there would be some visible indications of gipsy life,
if it was nothing more than the pawn-tickets for
stolen spoons.</p>

<p>He thought to find at least one or two beautiful
babies knocking about, decorated with coral necklaces
and golden clasps, suggestive of rich parents
and better days, and had firmly resolved to send the
little innocents to the alms-house by way of improving
their condition. Full of these romantic notions,
the reporter started on his philanthropic mission,
taking the preliminary precaution of leaving at home
his watch and pocket-book, and carrying with him
only small change enough to pay the advertised
charges.</p>

<p>In one of those three-story brick houses so abounding
in this city, which seem to have been built by the
mile and cut off in slices to suit purchasers, in the
Third Avenue above Eighteenth Street, dwelt at that
time the gay Bohemian. The building in which she
lived, though three stories in height, is very short<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
between joints, which style of architecture makes all
the rooms low and squat, as if somebody had shut the
house into itself like a telescope, and had never pulled
it out again.</p>

<p>Out of the chimney, which was the little end of the
telescope, issued a sickly smoke; and through a door
in the lower story, which was the big end thereof,
was the stranger admitted by a little girl. This girl
was, probably, a pure article of gipsy herself originally,
but had been so much adulterated by partial
civilization that she combed her hair daily and submitted
to shoes and stockings without a murmur.
Ragged indeed was this reclaimed wanderer; saucy
and dirty-faced was this sprouting young maiden, but
she was sharp-witted, and scented money as quickly
as if she had been the oldest hag of her tribe; so she
asked her customer to walk up stairs, which he did.
She herself went up stairs with a skip and a whirl,
showed her visitor into the grand reception room
with a gyrating flourish, and disappeared in a “courtesy”
of so many complex and dizzy rotations that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
she seemed to the eyes of the bewildered traveller to
evaporate in a red flannel mist. As soon as she had
spun herself out of sight he recovered his presence of
mind and looked about him.</p>

<p>The romantic gipsy who sojourned here had tried
to furnish her rooms like civilized people, doubtless
out of respect to her many patrons. A thread-bare
carpet was under foot; a little parlor stove with a
little fire in it was standing on a little piece of zinc,
and did its little utmost to heat the room; an uncomfortable
looking sofa covered with shabby and faded
red damask graced one side of the apartment, and a
lounge, of curtailed dimensions, partially covered
with shreds of turkey red calico, adorned another
side.</p>

<p>This latter article of furniture, with its tattered
cover, through which suspicious bits of curled hair
peeped out, and wide crevices in its rickety frame
were plainly visible, looked much too suggestive of
cockroaches and other insect delicacies of the season
to be an inviting place of repose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Three chairs were dispersed throughout the room,
on one of which the reporter bestowed himself, and
the rest of the furniture consisted of a table, so
exceedingly shaky and sensitive in the joints that
it might have been the grim skeleton of some former
table, loosely hung together with unseen wires; and
a cheap looking-glass that had suffered so serious a
comminuted fracture as to be past all surgery—this
was all except some little plaster images of saints,
strangers to the Cash Customer, and a black rosary,
which article would seem to show that efforts had
been put forth to Christianize this nut-brown gipsy
maid.</p>

<p>A clinking of glasses was heard in the adjoining
apartment, then the door was opened with an independent
flirt, and the gay Bohemian appeared on the
scene.</p>

<p>If it were desired to fancy visions of enchanting
loveliness it would be necessary to insert therein other
ingredients than the gipsy girl of the Third Avenue;
alone she would be insufficient; too much would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
left to the imagination; and in any event the illusion
would be too great to last long.</p>

<p>She is of medium height, her eyes are brown and
bright, and her hands are very large and red. She
has no hair, but wears a scratch red wig, which gives
her head a utilitarian character. Her face is deeply
pitted with the small-pox, more than pitted—gullied,
scarred, and seamed, as though some jealous rival
had been trying to plough her complexion under;
little short light hairs are thinly scattered on her
cheek bones and upper lip, and in the shadows of
the little ridges that disease had left, irresistibly compelling
the mind to make an absurd comparison of
her face with a sterile field, and imagine that at some
past day it had been spaded up to plant a beard,
which had only grown in scanty patches, here and
there. Her nails were horny and ill-shaped, and
underneath them and at their roots were large deposits
of dirt and other fertilizing compounds, under
the stimulating influence of which they had grown
lank and long. Her attire was a sort of cross between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the picturesque wildness of the gipsy, and the more
civilized and unbecoming dress of Third Avenue
Christians.</p>

<p>She was apparelled, principally, in a red flannel
jacket, and a check handkerchief, which was passed
under her chin and tied on the top of her wig, where
the knot looked like a blue butterfly. There was a
gown, but a series of subsoiling experiments would
have been necessary to determine the material and
texture; the surface was palpably dirt. Accompanying
her there was a strong smell of gin, and from the
odor of the liquor the visitor judged that it was a
very poor article.</p>

<p>This gay old gipsy drew a chair to the table, and
sat down, not in a graceful and composed manner,
but more as if she had been dumped from a cart.
She soon partially recovered herself, and straightened
up slightly from the heap into which she had collapsed,
and, turning her head away from her customer,
she elaborately remarked: “Fifty cents and your left
’and.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>”</p>

<p>The Individual made a careful search for his small
change, and fished out the exact amount which he
promptly paid over.</p>

<p>This delightful gipsy then took his left hand and
looked at it for a minute in an imbecile kind of way,
as if she didn’t know exactly what to do with it, and
was undecided whether it was to be made into soup,
or she was to drink it immediately with warm water
and a little sugar. This last impression evidently
prevailed, for she tried to pour it into her apron, and
only recovered from her delusion when the fingers
tangled themselves up in the strings. Then a glimmering
of the true state of the case seemed to dawn
upon her, and she began to have a dim idea that she
was expected to say something.</p>

<p>Now the roving gipsy was not by any means intoxicated
at this time; that is to say, she may have
been partaking of gin, or gin and water, or may have
been sucking sugar that had gin on it, or she may
have been taking a little gin and peppermint for a
stomach-ache, or she may have been bathing her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
head in gin, or have been otherwise making use
of that potent remedy as a medicine, but she was by
no means a subject for official interference in case she
had wandered into the street, but she was, to tell the
truth, not in her most clear-headed condition; although
probably she did not see more than one Cash Customer
sitting solemnly before her, still that one was quite as
many as she could well manage at that time.</p>

<p>After the signal failure of her little demonstration
on the hand of her guest, she, by a strong effort,
seemed to concentrate her faculties, and after several
trials she roused herself and spoke as follows, emphasizing
the short words with spiteful vindictiveness,
and paying the most particular attention to the improper
aspiration of the h’s.</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> a person as <i>has</i> seen a great deal <i>of</i> dif—”</p>

<p>The gay Bohemian here evidently desired to say
“difficulty,” but the word was a sad stumbling-block,
a four-syllable rock ahead which was too much for
her powers in her then exhausted state of mind; she
charged on the unfortunate word boldly, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and tried to carry it by storm, but each time was
repulsed with great loss of breath—“a great deal of
dif—dif—dif—diffle”—it was no use, so she tried back
and began again.</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> a man as <i>has</i> seen a great deal of <i>diffleculency</i>,”
was what she said, but it didn’t seem to satisfy
her, so she tried again, and after a number of trials she
hit a happy medium between “<i>dif</i>” and “<i>diffleculency</i>”
and compromised on “<i>difflety</i>,” which useful addition
to the language she took occasion to repeat as often as
possible with an air of decided triumph.</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> a man as <i>has</i> seen a great deal of difflety
<i>and</i> trouble—I would not go <i>to</i> say you ’ave been
through too much difflety <i>and</i> trouble, still you ’ave
seen difflety <i>and</i> trouble. If you had been a luckier
man <i>in</i> your past life you <i>would</i> not ’ave seen <i>so</i> much
difflety and trouble, still you <i>’ave</i> seen difflety <i>and</i>
trouble—I ’ope you will not see so much difflety <i>and</i>
trouble <i>in</i> the future—Life: you <i>will</i> live long; you
will live <i>to</i> be 69 years of <i>hage and will</i> die of a lingering
disease—you <i>will</i> be sick for a long time, and <i>will</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
not suffer much difflety and trouble—sixty-nine years
of <i>hage</i> you <i>will</i> live to be—Death: don’t think <i>of</i>
death; that is <i>too</i> far hoff a you <i>to</i> think of—but you
<i>will</i> die when you <i>are</i> 69 years of hage, and you <i>may</i>
’ope to go right hup to ’eaven, for you <i>will</i> ’ave no
more difflety and trouble then—Money: you <i>will</i> ’ave
money, and you <i>will</i> ’ave plenty of money, but you
must not look for money until <i>you</i> ’ave reached your
middle <i>hage</i>—a distant Hinglish relative of yours <i>will</i>
leave you money, but you <i>will</i> ’ave difflety <i>and</i> trouble
in getting it; do not hexpect <i>to</i> get <i>this</i> money without

<p>Thus prophesied the gay Bohemian, the nut-brown
maid, the dark-eyed oracle, the wise charmer, the
female seer, the beautiful sibyl, the lovely enchantress,
the romantic “gipsy girl” of the Third Avenue.</p>

<p>Romance and poesy were effectually demolished by
the overpowering realities of dirt, vulgarity, cockneyism,
ignorance, scratch-wigs, bad English, and bad gin.
Sadly the Individual walked down stairs behind the
gyrating girl, who reappeared with an agile pirouette,
twirled down on her toes, and opened the door with a
dizzy revolution that made her look as if her head and
shoulders had got into a whirlpool of petticoats, and
were past all hope of mortal rescue. The little chink,
as of a bottle and glass, came faintly from the apartment
which is the home of the gipsy, and the individual
fancied that the gay Bohemian had returned to
her devotions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<hr />

<h3>MADAME FLEURY, No. 263 BROOME STREET.</h3>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">From</span> what the reader has already perused of the predictions
and prophecies of these modern dealers in
magic, he will hardly think them of a character to
inspire any great degree of confidence in the minds of
people of ordinary common sense. Still less will he
be disposed to believe that merchants of “credit and
renown;” business men, engaged in occupations, the
operations of which are presumed to be governed by
the nicest mathematical calculations, are ever so far
influenced by the miserable jargon of these “fortune-tellers,”
as to seriously consult them in business matters
of great importance.</p>

<p>Such, however, is the humiliating truth.</p>

<p>There are in New York city a number of merchants,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
bankers, brokers, and other persons eminent
in the business world, and respectable in all social
relations, who never make an important business
move in any direction, until after consultation with
one or another of the Witches of New York.</p>

<p>There are many who are regular periodical customers,
and who visit the shrine of the oracle once a
month, or once in six weeks, as regularly as they
make out their balance-sheets, or take an account of
stock, and who guide their future investments and
business ventures as much by the written fifty-cent
prophecy as by either of the other documents.</p>

<p>Many country merchants have also learned this
trick, and some of them are in constant correspondence
with the cheap sybils of Grand Street; and
others, when they come to the city for their stock of
goods for the next half year, visit their chosen fortune-teller
and get full and explicit directions how to conduct
their business for the coming six months. Of
course, these proceedings are conducted with the greatest
possible secrecy, and the attention of the writer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
was first awakened to this fact by the indiscreet boastings
of certain ones of the witches themselves, who
are not a little proud of their influence, and after
observations afforded ample proof and corroboration
of all he had been told.</p>

<p>Great money enterprises have without doubt been
seriously affected by the yea or nay of the Bible and
key, and perhaps the Atlantic Cable Company would
have received more hearty assistance, and its stock
more extensive subscriptions in Wall Street, if certain
ones of the fortune-tellers had possessed more faith in
its success, and had so advised their patrons.</p>

<p>Incredible as these statements may seem, they are
nevertheless true, and this fact is another proof that
gross superstition is not confined to the low and filthy
parts of the city, where rags and dirt are the universal
rule, but that it has likewise a thrifty growth in quarters
of the town where stand the palaces of the “merchant
princes,” and in avenues where rags are
almost unknown, and broadcloth, and gold, and fine-twined
linen are the common wear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>It is said that certain counsel eminent in the learned
profession of the law, and that certain even of the
judges of the bench, have been known to consult the
female practicers of the Black Art, but the author has
never been personally cognizant of a case of this kind,
and has no means of knowing whether the consultation
was intended to benefit the lawyer or the witch;
whether the former desired enlightenment as to the
management of some knotty professional point, or
whether the latter wanted legal advice as to some of
the side branches of her business.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Fleury</i>, whose domicile and mode of procedure
are described in this present chapter, has a large run
of this sort of what may be termed <i>respectable</i> custom,
and she does not fail to profit by it to the utmost.
She came to New York, from France, about six or
seven years ago, and at once established herself in the
witch business, which she could advertise extensively
in the papers, although the other branches of her profession,
by which she probably makes more money
than by telling fortunes, would by no means bear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
newspaper publicity. What these other branches
are, is more explicitly stated in other chapters of
this book, and, in fact, needs to be but hinted at, to
be at once understood by nearly all who read.</p>

<p>Madame Fleury advertised the world of her arrival
in America, and of her supernatural powers, and in a
short time customers began to flock in. It is now her
boast that she has as “respectable a connexion” as
any one in the trade, and that she has as great a
number of “regular, reliable customers,” as any
conjuress in America. She says that most of her
“regular customers” visit her once in six weeks, six
being with her a favorite number, and she not undertaking
to guarantee her <i>business</i> predictions for a
greater length of time.</p>

<p>Whether she makes any discount from her ordinary
prices to these regular traders, she did not state, but probably
witchcraft is governed by the same rule as other
commodities, and comes cheaper to wholesale dealers.</p>

<p>Duly armed and equipped with staff and scrip, and
duly fortified within by such stimulants as the exigencies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of the case seemed to demand, the Cash Customer
set out for 263 Broome Street, and after strict trial and
due examination of the premises and the people, he
made the following report.</p>

<p>It was a favorite remark of a learned though mistaken
philosopher of the olden time, that “you can’t
make a whistle of a pig’s tail.” The philosopher died,
but his saying was accepted by the world as an axiom—a
bit of incontrovertible truth, eternal, Godlike,
fully up to par, worth a hundred per cent., with no
possibility of discount. Time, however, which often
demonstrates the fallibility of human wisdom, has not
spared even this oft-quoted adage; and now there is
not a collection of curiosities in the land which lacks
a pig-tail whistle to proclaim in the shrillest tones the
falsity of the wise man’s proposition, and the triumph
of Yankee ingenuity. Had this same philosopher
been interrogated on the subject, he would undoubtedly
have announced, and with an equal show of
probability on his side of the argument, that “you
can’t make a star-reading prophetess out of a snuffy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
old woman;” but had he lived to the present day,
the Cash Customer would have taken great pleasure
in exhibiting to him these two apparently irreconcilable
characters combined in a single person, and that
person Mrs. Fleury, who pays for the daily insertion
of the following advertisement in the newspapers.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“ASTROLOGY.—<span class="smcap">Mrs. Fleury</span>, from Paris, is the most celebrated
lady of the present age, in telling future events, true and
certain. She answers questions on business, marriage, absent
friends, &amp;c., by magnetism. Office No. 263 Broome-st.”</p></div>

<p>There is not so much of promise in this paragraph,
as there is in some of the more grandiloquent announcements
of the other witches—not probably, that
Madame Fleury is any less pretentious than they, but
her knowledge of the English language is not perfect
enough to enable her to give her ideas their full effect.</p>

<p>The Cash Customer resolved to visit this “most
celebrated lady of the age,” who had come all the
way from Paris, to tell his “future events true and
certain,” nothing daunted by the circumstance that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
she lives in the filthiest part of Broome Street, which
has never been swept clean since it was a very new
Broome indeed.</p>

<p>If our fancy farmers, who expend so much money
upon the various foreign manures and fertilizing compounds,
would but turn their eyes in the direction of
Broome Street, a single glance would convince them
of the inexhaustible resources of their own country,
while guano would instantly depreciate in value, and
the island of Ichaboe not be worth a quarrel. This
prolific and valuable deposit that covers Broome Street
bears perennial crops: in the spring and summer,
dirty-faced children and mean-looking dogs seem to
spring from it spontaneously; they are succeeded
during the colder weather by a crop of tumble-down
barrels, and cast-away broken carts; while the humbler
and more insignificant things, the uncared for weeds,
so to speak, of the abundant harvest, such as potato
parings, and fish heads, and shreds of ragged dish-cloths,
and bits of broken crockery, and old bones,
are in season all the year round.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>In the midst of this filth, with policy-shops adjacent,
and pawnbrokers’ offices close at hand, and rum shops
convenient in the neighborhood—where the reeking
streets and stagnant gutters, and the heaps of decomposing
garbage, send up a stench so thick and heavy
that it beslimes everything it touches, and makes a
man feel as if he were far past the saving powers of
soap and soft water, and was fast dissolving into rancid
lard oil—in this congenial atmosphere flourishes the
prophetess, and here is found the mansion of Mrs.
Fleury, “the most celebrated lady of the age in telling
future events.” Her mansion is not one that would
be selected as a permanent residence by any one with
a superabundance of cash capital, nor did it seem
quite suited to the deservings of the “most celebrated
lady of the present age;” the house, a three-story
brick, originally intended to be something above the
common, has been for so many years misused and
badly treated by reckless tenants, that it has completely
lost its good temper, as well as its good looks,
and is now in a perpetual state of aggravated sulkiness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
It resents the presence of a stranger as an
impertinent intrusion, and avenges the personality in
various disagreeable ways. It twitches its rickety
stairways impatiently under his feet, as if to shake
him off and damage him by the fall—it viciously
attempts to pinch and jam his fingers with moody
dogged doors, which hold back as long as they can,
and then close with a sudden snap, exceedingly
dangerous to the unwary—it tears his clothes with
ambushed rusty nails, and unsuspected hooks, and
sharp and jagged splinters—it creaks its floors under
his tread with a doleful whine, and complains of his
cruel treatment in sharp-pointed, many-cornered tears
of plaster, which it drops from the ceiling upon his
head the instant he takes his hat off—it yawns its
wide cellar doors open like a greedy mouth, evidently
hoping that an unlucky step will pitch him headlong
down—and it conducts itself in a thousand ill-natured
ways like a sulky child that has been waked up too
early in the morning, and not properly whipped into
good behavior. The Individual, however, entered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the doors, unabashed by the malignant scowl which
was visible all over the face of the unamiable mansion,
and stumbled through a narrow, dirty hall, up two
flights of groaning stairs, before he discovered any
sign of the whereabouts of Madame. She evidently
did not occupy the entire of this sulky edifice, or he
would have seen some of the servants or retainers, who
would have been only too happy to direct him to the
head-quarters of the sorceress. But the few people he
saw about the place seemed to be each one occupied
with his or her own private affairs, and to be too much
taken up therewith to pay the slightest attention to
the new-comer. Their attentions to each other were
confined to reproaches, uncomplimentary assertions,
and sundry maledictory remarks, accompanied, in
case of the younger members of the various tribes,
with pinches, pokes, punches, and small but frequent
showers of brickbats.</p>

<p>The Individual disregarded these evidences of
good feeling, not considering himself called upon to
reply to any which were not addressed to him individually,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
and plodded on till his roving eye rested on
a tin sign, on which was inscribed, “Madame Fleury,
Room No. 4.” There were no mysterious emblems
or cabalistic flourishes accompanying this simple
announcement.</p>

<p>He pulled the knob and the door was instantly
opened by the lady herself, so quickly that the bell
had no time to ring until all necessity for it was over—she
had evidently heard the advancing footsteps of
her customer, and had stood ready to pounce upon
him. She ushered him into the apartment, where
he soon recovered his self-possession, and took an
observation.</p>

<p>The room was a small square one, shabbily furnished
with very few articles of furniture, and these
were dimly visible through the snuffy mist which filled
the apartment; there was snuff everywhere; there
was a snuffy dust on the chairs; there was a precipitate
of snuff on the floor, and, if snuff was capable of
crystallization, there would undoubtedly have been
stalactitic formations of snuff depending from the ceiling;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the Madame herself was snuff-colored, as if she
had been boiled in a decoction of tobacco.</p>

<p>She is a Frenchwoman, and has had about half a
century’s experience of her present fleshly tabernacle,
which is somewhat the worse for wear, although from
the fossil remains of bygone beauty, still visible in her
ancient countenance, her customer inclined to the
belief that in some remote age she was comely and
pleasant to the eye. He founded this hypothesis
upon the brown hair and hazel eyes which time has
spared.</p>

<p>In respect to personal cleanliness, the Individual
regrets to say that the Madame was not in every
respect what a critical observer would wish to see;
her hands and arms were in a condition which would
naturally lead to the belief that the Croton Corporation
had cut off the water; and under each of her
finger-nails was a dark-colored deposit, which may
have been snuff, but looked like something dirtier.
She was dressed in a light striped calico dress, over
which was a black velvet mantle trimmed with fur,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
and on her head was a portentous head-dress which
was fearfully and wonderfully made of shabby black
lace; her face was in the same condition as her hands
and arms, as was also her neck, which was only visible
to the upper edge of the collar-bone—further
deponent saith not.</p>

<p>She more nearly approached the Cash Customer’s
notion of the Witch of Endor, than any other lady
he had ever heard mentioned in polite society. She
at once prepared for business.</p>

<p>She seated herself behind a small stand, dusty with
snuff, on which were a number of little books on
astrology, written in French and German, and as
dirty and as fragrant as if they had been some kind
of clumsy vegetable which had been grown in a
tobacco plantation.</p>

<p>She asked her visitor if he spoke French or German,
to which he replied that, had he been conversant
with all the languages invented at the Babel smash-up,
he would on this occasion, for particular reasons, prefer
to confine himself to English. He also ventured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
an inquiry as to terms, upon which she produced a
card containing a list of her charges, printed in English,
French, and German. He learned from this
dingy document that the prices of telling fortunes by
lines of the hand, by cards, and by the stars, varied in
amount from one to five dollars. The Individual concluded
that one dollar’s worth would suffice, and,
approaching the little table, he announced the result
of his cogitations. The enchantress, who was so
saturated with snuff and tobacco that every time her
customer looked her in the face he sneezed, then
brought a pack of very filthy cards, which were
covered over with mysterious hieroglyphics done in
black paint. She asked her visitor to “cut” them,
which he reverently though daintily did, whereupon
she laid them on the table before her in four rows,
and spoke, having previously explained that she used
no witchcraft but did all her wonders by the signs of
the zodiac. The Individual concentrated his attention,
and listened with all his ears while the witch of
Broome Street spoke thus:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will tell you first what these cards indicate, then
I will look at the lines of your hand, and then I will
answer three questions.”</p>

<p>Here she paused, while her agitated listener sneezed
a couple of times; then she resumed, speaking with a
strong foreign accent:</p>

<p>“You are good disposition—have excellent memory,
you don’t have many enemy, but what you do
is of your own sex—you are very frank person and
you was born in the sign of the Crab. You have
some lucky days which are Mondays, Thursdays, and
Fridays, whatever you do on these days is well, but
you shall not wash your hair on Thursdays, if so, you
will wash all your luck away. You must be very
careful of fire and water, you will be in great danger
of fire and water and you must be very careful. You
may die by fire or water, I cannot say but you must
certain be very careful of fire and water. You must
also be very careful of dogs, very careful of dogs,
you may die by a dog, but you must certain be very
careful of dogs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>”</p>

<p>Here she paused again, and while her visitor was
meditating on the full force of what he had heard,
and was inwardly resolving to go immediately home,
shoot Juno, and drown her as-yet-unoffending-but-in-after-days-dangerous-to-his-peace-of-mind-and-the-happiness-of-his-life
pups, she prepared for the second
portion of her discourse.</p>

<p>Taking the Individual’s hand in hers, a proceeding
which made him feel as if he had put his fingers into
a bladder of Maccoboy, she made the following prediction:
“You will be the father of five children, two
of them will be boys, who will be a great comfort to
you when you grow old.”</p>

<p>She spoke no good of the girls, and the customer
foresaw feminine trouble in his household with those
same young ladies. Having a few moments to himself
before she resumed, he worked himself into a
great passion with the ungrateful hussies who were
about to treat their kind old father in so scandalous a
manner; but presently recollecting that they were as
yet in the condition of “your sister, Betsey Trotwood,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
who never was born,” he felt that he was slightly
premature in his wrath, so he cooled down and
resolved to make the best of it with his comfortable
boys.</p>

<p>The yellow sorceress continued: “Your line of
life is long, and you will live to a good old age. You
have had much trouble in love affairs, and now your
first love is entirely lost to you. You can never
reclaim her, and you must never venture anything in
lotteries.”</p>

<p>Whether Madame Fleury supposed that her visitor
intended to spend his salary in lottery tickets, in the
hope of winning back his early love, or whether she
supposed that the woman then exhibiting herself as
“Perham’s Gift Lady,” was the person, is not in evidence;
but, from the peculiar construction of her last
remark, something of the kind must have been in her
thoughts. She had now reached the third part of her
discourse, and come to the “three questions.” She
produced an old French Bible, dingy with age and
snuff, and which she informed the observer had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
in her family for three hundred years; an old iron
key was tied between the leaves, with the ring and
part of the shank of the key projecting, and the
Bible was tightly bound round with many folds of
black ribbon. Making her visitor hold one side of
the ring of the key, while she held the other, she said:
“Ask your three questions, and if they are to be
answered in the affirmative the book will turn.”</p>

<p>The Individual, who had been much impressed by
her canine observation of a few minutes before, and
whose thoughts were still running upon his pet Juno,
and her six innocent offspring, in a fit of absence of
mind propounded this interrogatory:</p>

<p>“Shall I marry the person of whom I am now
thinking?” The potent enchantress repeated the
question aloud in French, and then, with pale lips
and trembling voice, she addressed the book and key
thus:</p>

<p>“Holy Bible, I ask you, in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost, will this man marry the
person now in his mind?”—then she closed her eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
for a moment, placed one hand over her heart, and
rapidly muttered something in so low a tone that it
was inaudible to her listener. Immediately the Bible
commenced to turn slowly towards her, and soon had
made a complete revolution, thus expressing a very
decided affirmative.</p>

<p>Having started a matrimonial subject with so satisfactory
a result, her customer thought he could do no
better than to follow it up, and accordingly asked
question No. 2:</p>

<p>“If I marry this person, will the marriage be a
happy one?” The same answer was given, in the
same manner. Being now satisfied as to his own
matrimonial prospects, he concluded to ascertain those
of his children, and question No. 3 was asked, as follows:</p>

<p>“Shall I live to see my children happily married?”</p>

<p>There was a long delay, which was undoubtedly
occasioned by the difficulty of properly providing for
those refractory girls, but at last there came a reluctant
“Yes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>”</p>

<p>Having now got all that his dollar entitled him
to, the customer prepared to depart. The Madame
informed him that in a few days she would have her
“<i>Magic Mirror</i>” from Paris, with which she could do
new wonders, and she hoped that he would soon call
again, adding, “If I was ten year younger I would
not admit gentlemen, but now I am old and I must.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>”</p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Besides</span> those who advertise in the daily journals,

does not boast its old crones of fortune-telling celebrity—women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
who are not named by the awe-struck
youngsters of the town, but with low breath and a
startled sort of look thrown backward over the
shoulder every minute as if in half-fear that the evil
eye is even there upon them. And in almost every
neighborhood in any part of the country, there
will be one or more old women who delight in mystifying
the young folks by telling fortunes in tea-cups,
by means of the ominous settling of the “grounds;”—or
who, sometimes, even “run the cards,” or aspire to
read the fates by the portentous turning of the Bible
and key. All these conjurations are given without
money and without price in the rural districts, but
they sometimes work no little mischief.</p>

<p>There people do not advertise their willingness to
read the fates, and only exercise their gifts in that
direction as a matter of friendship to certain favored
ones. The city and the suburbs are full of people of
this kind, who profess to know the gift of prophecy
and of miracles, but who do not make their whole
living by the exercise of their supernatural powers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
depending in part on some popular branch of industry.
They differ, however, from their sisters of the
country in this regard; whenever they do consent
to do a little magic for the accommodation of an
anxious inquirer, they are very careful to charge him
a round price for it. Many of them combine fortune-telling
with hard work, and do their full day’s work
of faithful toil at some legitimate employment, and in
the evening amuse themselves with witchcraft.</p>

<p>These are chrysalis witches; prophets in embryo;
magicians in a state of apprenticeship; they are learning
the trade, and as soon as they feel competent to
do journey-work, they drop their hard labor, and at
once set up for full-fledged witches or conjurors.</p>

<p>Mr. Grommer, the Black Sage of Williamsburgh,
and his solid and amiable wife, were in this half-way
state when they were visited by the Cash Customer.
Their fame had reached his ears by the means of some
kind friends who were cognisant of his peculiar investigations
at that time, and who told him of the supernatural
gifts of this amiable old couple.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly the Individual, having made exact
inquiries as to their local habitation, one fine morning
set out in pursuit, and in due time made up the
following report. Since that time it is reported that
this worthy pair have followed the law of progression
hereinbefore hinted at, and having arrived at the
fulness of all magical knowledge, have laid aside
the whitewash pail and discarded the scrubbing-brush,
and given their time entirely to the practice of
the Black Art.</p>

<p>The Individual beginneth his discourse thus:—</p>

<p>It is an old saying, that “The Devil is never so
black as he is painted.” What may be the precise
shade of the complexion of his amiable majesty the
Cash Customer has no means of ascertaining to an
exact nicety at this present time of writing; but he
makes the positive assertion, that some of the Satanic
human employees are so black as to need no painting
of any description.</p>

<p>Whether or not the ancient “wise men from the
East” were swarthy skinned he is not competent to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
decide; but he is able to prove, by ocular demonstration,
to an unbelieving sceptic, that some of the
modern “wise men” are particularly “dark-complected.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grommer, of No. 34 North Second Street, in
the suburb of Williamsburgh, is a case in point.
The fame of this illustrious ebony lady had gone
abroad through the land, and her skill in prophecy
had been vouched for by those who professed to have
personal knowledge of the truthfulness of her predictions.
But an air of mystery surrounded the sable
sorceress, and it was declared to be impossible to
obtain a knowledge of her exact whereabouts, except
by a preliminary visit to a certain mysterious “cave,”
the locality of which was accurately described.</p>

<p>A cave! this promised well; no other witches
encountered by the Cash Customer, had he found
in a cave, or in anything resembling that hollow
luxury.</p>

<p>A cave! the very word smacked of diabolism, and
had the true flavor of genuine witchcraft. Our overjoyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
hero thought of the Witch of Vesuvius in
her mountain cavern—of her lank, grey, dead hair;
her livid, corpse-like skin; her stony eye; her
shrivelled, blue lips; her hollow voice, and her
threatening arm, and skinny, menacing forefinger—of
the red-eyed fox at her side, the crested serpent at
her feet, the mystic lamp above her head, and the
statue in the background, triple-headed with skulls
of dog, and horse, and boar. Something of this kind
he hoped to witness in the present instance, for
he argued that any sorceress who lived in a cave
must surely be supplied with some more cabalistic
instruments with which to work her spells than
greasy playing-cards or rusty brass door-keys. At
last, then, he had discovered something in modern
witchcraft worthy the ancient romance of the name.
Triumphant and overjoyed, he prepared for the visit,
confident in his ability to witness any spectacle,
however terrible, without flinching, and in his courage
to pass any ordeal, however fearful. He swallowed
no countercharms or protective potions, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
did not even take the precaution to sew a horse-shoe
in the seat of his pantaloons.</p>

<p>It is true he was rash, but much must be forgiven
to youthful curiosity, especially when conjoined with
professional ambition. The carelessness, in respect
to his own safety, was productive of no ill effects, for
he returned from this perilous excursion in every
regard as good as he went. He had by this time
entirely recovered from his matrimonial aspirations,
and had given up all hope of a witch wife. Still, he
hoped to find in the <i>cave</i>, something more worthy the
ancient and honorable name of witchcraft than anything
he had yet seen.</p>

<p>Alas! for the uncertainty of mortal hopes. All is
vanity, bosh, and botheration.</p>

<p>On arriving at the enchanted spot, it soon became
evident to the senses of our astonished friend that
the “Cave” was not a cavern, fit for the habitation
of a powerful sorceress, but was merely a mystifying
cognomen applied to a drinking saloon with a billiard
room attached, which had accommodations, also, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
persons who wished to participate in other profane
games.</p>

<p>On entering the “Cave,” your deluded customer
saw no toothless hag with the expected witch-like
surroundings, but observed only a company of men,
seemingly respectable, indulging in plentiful potations
of beer and certain other liquids, which
appeared, at the distance from which he observed
them, to be the popular compounds designated in the
vulgar tongue as “whiskey toddies.” Addressing the
nearest bystander, the gulled Individual ascertained
the habitation of Mrs. Grommer, and immediately
departed in search of that interesting female.</p>

<p>The way was crooked, as all Williamsburgh ways
are, but after an irregular, curvilinear journey of
half an hour, the anxious inquirer stood in front of
the looked-for mansion.</p>

<p>The grading of the street has left at this point a
gravel bank some six or eight feet high, on the summit
of which is perched the house of Mrs. Grommer,
like a contented mud-turtle on a sunny stump. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
a one-story affair, with several irregular wings or
additions sprouting out of it at unexpected angles,
and, on the whole, it looks as if it had been originally
built tall and slim like a tallow candle, but
had melted and run down into its present indescribable
shape. The architect neglected to provide this
beautiful edifice with a front door, and the inquirer
was compelled to ascend the bank by a flight of rheumatic
steps, and make a grand detour through currant
bushes, chickens, washtubs, rain-barrels, and
colored children, irregular as to size, and variegated
as to hue, to the back, and only door. Here his
modest rap was unanswered, and he composedly
walked in, unasked, through the kitchen, and took a
seat in the parlor, where he was presently discovered
by the lady of the house, but not until he had time to
take an accurate observation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grommer had, up to this time, been engaged
in making a public example of certain ones of her
grandchildren, who had been trespassing on the currant
bushes of a neighbor, and had been caught in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
the act. Their indulgent grandmother, being scandalized
by this exhibition of youthful depravity, with a
regard for the demands of strict justice that did her
infinite credit, had inflicted on several of the delinquents
that mild punishment known as “spanking.”
The novelty of the sight had drawn together quite a
collection of the neighbors, who signified their
approval of the deed by encouraging cheers.</p>

<p>Meantime the Individual had ample time to
contemplate the inside beauties of the mansion of the
sable prophet. Mrs. Grommer soon finished her
athletic exercise out-doors, and came into the house
to rearrange her dress and receive her company.</p>

<p>The reception-room was about 10 by 12, and so low
that a tall man could not yawn in it without rapping
his head against the ceiling. In places the plaster
had been displaced and the bare lath showed through,
reminding one of skeletons. The floor was dingily
carpeted; a double bed occupied one side of the room,
a small cooking-stove stood in the middle of the floor
and had a disproportionately slim pipe issuing out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
the corner, like a straw in a mint-julep; seven chairs
of varied patterns, a small round table, on which lay
a pack of cards covered with a cloth, and a tumble-down
chest of drawers completed the necessary furniture
of the apartment. The ornaments are quickly
enumerated. A black wooden cross hung by the
windows, a few cheap and gaudy Scriptural prints
were fastened against the wall, a chemist’s bottle, of
large dimensions, and filled with a blue liquid, reposed
on the chest of drawers, side by side with a few miniature
casts of lambs and dogs; and on a little shelf
stood a quarter-size plaster bust of some unknown
worthy, of which the head had been knocked off and
its place significantly supplied with a goose-egg.</p>

<p>In a short time Mrs. Grommer emerged from an
unlooked-for apartment and entered the room. She
is a negress and a grandmother—her age is 65, and a
brood of children, together with a swarm of the aforesaid
grandchildren, reside near at hand and keep the
old lady’s mansion constantly besieged.</p>

<p>As to size—she is large, apparently solid, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
would struggle severely with a 200 pound weight
before she would acknowledge herself conquered.
She was neatly attired, and, in fact, a most grateful
air of cleanliness pervaded the entire establishment,
and it was a refreshing contrast to most of the dens
of the fairer-skinned witches heretofore encountered
by the cash delegate.</p>

<p>The sable one entered into conversation, and a few
minutes were passed in cheerful chat, in the course of
which she thus referred to the scapegrace husband of
one of her numerous daughters: “They think Anson
is dead, but I can’t station him dead. I think he’s at
sea somewhere, or in a foreign land, but I can’t station
him dead. He might as well be under ground for all
the good he is, for he is such a poor, mis’able, drinkin’
feller that he aint no use, but, after all, I can’t run
him dead.”</p>

<p>At last, the object of the visit was mentioned, and,
to the individual’s great surprise, Mrs. Grommer positively
and peremptorily refused to give him the
benefit of her prophetic powers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>She said: “It aint no use; I never does for gentlemen.
I does sometimes for ladies, but I can’t do it
for gentlemen.” Remonstrance and entreaty were
alike useless; she was immovable. At last, she said
she would call her “old man,” who could tell fortunes
as well as she could, but she added, with a determined
shake of the head: “He’ll do it, but he will charge
you a dollar; and he wont do it under, neither.”
When her hearer expressed his willingness to learn
his future fate by the masculine medium, she
addressed him thus: “You station there, in that
chair, and I’ll send him.” The disappointed one
“stationed” in the designated chair, and awaited the
coming of the “old man.” He soon appeared and
seated himself, ready to begin.</p>

<p>“Old Man” Grommer is a professor of the whitewashing
branch of decorative art. He occasionally
relaxes his noble mind from the arduous mental labor
attendant upon the successful carrying on of his regular
business, and condescends to earn an easy dollar
by fortune-telling. He is a shrewd-looking old man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
with a dash of white blood in his composition; his
hair curls tightly all over his head, but is elaborated
on each side of his face into a single hard-twisted ringlet;
short crisped whiskers, streaked with grey, encircle
his face, and an imperial completes his hirsute
attractions; his cheeks and forehead are marked with
the small-pox.</p>

<p>He was attired in a grey and striped dress, the
peculiarity of which was that the coat and vest were
bound with wide stripes of black velvet. He speaks
with but little of the peculiar negro dialect, except when
he forgets himself for an instant, and unguardedly
relapses into the old habits, which he has evidently
carefully endeavored to overcome. He looked at his
visitor very sharply for a minute or two, while he pretended
to be abstractedly shuffling the cards; and
collecting his valuable thoughts, at last he remarked:</p>

<p>“I s’pose you want me to run the cards for you?”
The reply was in the affirmative, and the colored
prophet concentrated his mind and began. Slowly he
dealt the cards, and spake as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>“You don’t believe in fortunes, my son—I see that.
Must tell you what I see here—can’t help it—if I see
it in the cards, must tell you. You’ve had great deal
trouble, my son; more comin’. Can’t help it; mus’
tell you. I see trouble in de cards; I see razackly
what it is.”</p>

<p>Here he suddenly stopped, and resuming his
guarded manner, continued: “You’ve lost something,
my son; something that you think a great deal of.
Now I don’t like to tell about lost things; I’se ’fraid
I’ll get myself into a snare; I’d rather not say nothing
about it; fear I’ll get myself into trouble.” His auditor
here gave him the most positive assurances that he
should never be called into court to identify the thief
of the missing article, and that he should be held free
from all harm; whereupon he consented to impart
the following information:</p>

<p>“Dis thing you lost is something that hangs up on
a nail—something bright and round—you thinks a
great deal of it, my son—when it went away it had on
a bright guard—hasn’t got a bright guard on now;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
got a black guard—you see I knows all about de
article, my son, and I can tell you razackly where de
article is—but I’se rather not tell you ’bout it, my son;
’fraid I’ll run myself into a snare; dat’s the truth, my
son, rather no say nothin’ ’bout de article.”</p>

<p>Being again assured of safety, he went on: “Well,
my son, I’ll tell you ’bout this yer thing. Has you
got any boys in yer employ? No. Got two girls
have you? One of dem girls is light-haired and de
other is dark—the light one is de one who comes in
your room in your boarding-house every morning
when you’se gone away—’cause you lives in a boardin’
house, I sees that—can see it in the cards, can always
tell razackly. If you make a fuss about dat article
you make your landlady feel bad. You has accused
somebody of taking that article, but you ’cused de
wrong person. The light-haired girl is who’s got that
article. Can’t help it, my son, must tell you—de
light-haired girl is de person. Mebbe she’s put it
back, my son, I’ll see.”</p>

<p>Here he cut the cards carefully, and continued:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s trouble ’bout dat article, my son, can’t
help it, must tell you—but you’ll get the article, but
you’ll have disappointment. Whenever you see dat
card you may know there’s disappointment comin’—dat
card is always disappointment—can’t help it, my
son, must tell you.” Here he exhibited the nine of
spades, to the malignant influence of which he attributed
the future woes of his hearer.</p>

<p>“When you go home look in your bed between
the mattresses and see if the article is there, for
mebbe she’ll put it back—if it aint there you must
go to her and ’cuse her of it, ’cause it’s in the house
and she’s got it—can’t help it, my son, must tell
you.”</p>

<p>It is perhaps needless to say that the customer had
met with no loss of property, and that all this was
entirely gratuitous on the part of Mr. Grommer.
Having, however, settled the matter to his satisfaction,
that gentleman turned his attention to other
things, and in the intervals of repeated shufflings and
cuttings of the cards he said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dere is a journey for you soon—and dis journey
is going to be the best thing that ever happened to
you—but dere is a little disappointment first—can’t
help it, my son, must tell—here you can see for yourself,”
and out came the malicious nine of spades again.
“You will get money from beyond sea, my son—lots
of money, lots of money, my son—here it is, you can
see for yourself,” and he exhibited the cheerful faces
of the eight, nine, and ten of diamonds. “You will
have disappointment before you get this money,” and
up came the hateful visage of the nine of spades once
more. “You was born under a good star, my son—under
a morning star—you was born under the planet
Jupiter, my son, at 28 minutes past four in the morning—lucky
star, my son, very lucky star. You are
going to make a great change in your business, my
son, which will be good; you will always be successful
in business, but I think there is a little disappointment
first; can’t help it, must tell you.” Here the
listener looked for the nine of spades again, but it
didn’t come. “After a little while you turns your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
back on trouble; here, you can see for yourself—see,
this is you.”</p>

<p>The king of clubs was the Individual at that instant,
and the troubles upon which he turned his back are,
as nearly as he can remember, the knave of clubs, the
nine of spades, and the deuce of diamonds.</p>

<p>The sage went on. “I’m comin’ now to your marriage.
You’se goin’ to be married, but you’ll have
some disappointment first—can’t help it, my son, must
tell you. You see, here is a dark-complected lady
that you like, and she has a heart for you, but her
father don’t like you—he prefers a young man of
lighter complexion—see, here you all are, my son.
This is you,” and he showed the king of clubs—“and
this is her.” The “her” of whom he spoke so irreverently,
was the queen of clubs. “This is the heart she
has for you,” and he exhibited the seven of that
amorous suit. “This is her father”—the obstinate
and cruel “parient” here displayed, was the king
of spades—“and dis yer is de young man her father
likes,” and he placed before the eyes of the customer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
a hated rival in the shape of the knave of diamonds.
“You see how it is, my son, dere is trouble between
you—can’t help it. You may possibly marry de
dark-complected lady yet, but don’t you do it, my
son, don’t you do it—now mind I tell you, don’t you
do it—she is not the lady for you—can’t help it,
must tell you; if you marry dat lady you will be
sorry dat you ever tie de knot. See, here is the
knot,” and he showed the ace of diamonds. “See, this
is the lady you ought to marry,” and he produced
the queen of diamonds; “and she will be your second
wife if you do marry de dark-complected lady, but
you’d better marry her first if you can get her, and
let de dark-complected lady go for ebber; dat’s so, my
son, now mind I tell you.”</p>

<p>He condescended no more, and the Cash Customer
disbursed his dollar and departed, all the grandchildren
gathering on the bank to give him three cheers
as a parting salute.</p>

“Seventh daughter of a seventh daughter,” prophesies<br />

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></h2>

<hr />

<h3>MADAME CLIFTON, 185 ORCHARD STREET.</h3>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> there is no class of men brought constantly
and prominently before the public eye, that is so
great a puzzle to that public, as the class popularly
denominated “sporting men.” There is not a corner
on Broadway where they do not congregate; there is
not a theatre where they do not abound, and there is
not a concert-room that does not overrun with them.
There is a uniformity in their appearance that makes
them easily recognised, for they all affect the ultra
stylish in costume, even to the extreme of light kid
gloves in the street; they all have the crisp moustache,
the smooth-shaven cheeks, and the same keen,
ever-watchful eye, constantly on the look-out for a
“customer,” that respectable word meaning, in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
slang, a person to be victimized and swindled. Every
lady who walks the street has to run the gauntlet of
their insolent glances, and not unfrequently to hear
their vulgar and offensive criticisms on her personal
appearance; and every gentleman whose business
calls him into Broadway of a pleasant day, has seen
these persons grouped on the corner leisurely surveying
the passers-by, or gathered into a little knot
before some favorite rum-shop, discussing what is, to
them, the absorbing topic of the day—probably the
“good strike” Blobbsby made, “fighting the tiger,”
the night before; the “heavy run” a favorite billiard-player
made on a certain occasion, or the respective
chances of success of the two distinguished gentlemen
who may chance at that time to be in training with
a view of battering each other’s heads until one concedes
his claim to the brutal “honors” of the prize
ring.</p>

<p>No gentlemen of fashion and fortune are more
expensively dressed than these men; no class of people
wear more finely stitched and embroidered linen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
more costly broadcloth, more showy golden ornaments,
or more brilliant diamonds; but for all, the
man is yet to be found who has ever seen one of them
put his hand or his brain to one single hour’s honest
work. Unsophisticated persons are often puzzled to
account for the apparently irreconcilable circumstances
of no work, and plenty of money, and in their endeavors
to invent a plausible hypothesis on the basis
of honesty, must ever be bewildered. The city man
knows them at a glance to be “sporting men.”</p>

<p>This phrase is a particularly comprehensive one;
the “sporting man” is a gambler by profession, and
therefore a swindler by necessity, for an “honest
gambler” would fill a niche in the scale of created
beings that has never yet been occupied; in addition
to this, nearly every sporting man is a thief whenever
opportunity offers. They probably would not pick a
sober man’s pocket, or knock him down at night and
take his watch and money, for the risk of detection
would be too great; but they are kept from downright
stealing by no excess of virtue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>These remarks apply to the “sporting men,” by
profession—to those plausible gallows-birds who have
no other ostensible means of getting a living. There
are many men who sometimes spend an hour or two
at a faro table, or who occasionally pass an evening
in gambling at some other game, who do all fairly,
and are above all suspicion of foul play; these
persons are of course plundered by sharpers who
surround them, and are called “good fellows”
because they submit to their losses without grumbling.</p>

<p>The “sporting men” all have mistresses, on whom
they sometimes rely for funds whenever an “unlucky
hit,” or a “bad streak of luck,” has run their own
purses low.</p>

<p>It is not part of the present purpose of this book to
give particulars as to who and what their mistresses
are, further than to state that at least one or two of
the “Witches” described herein, officiate in that
capacity. It is true, that the most of them are not of
a style to tempt the lust of any man, but there are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
certain exceptions to the general rule, and in one or
two instances the “Individual” found the fortune-teller
to be comely and pleasant to the eye. As these
women generally have plenty of money, they are very
eligible partners for gamblers, who are liable to as
many reverses as ever Mr. Micawber encountered, and
who, when once down, might remain perpetually
floored, did not some kind friend set them on their
financial feet again.</p>

<p>And this is one of the duties of the monied mistress.
When the “sporting man” is in funds, no one is more
recklessly extravagant than he, and no one cuts a
greater dash than his “ladye-love,” if he chooses so to
do; but when the cards run cross, and the purse is
empty, it devolves upon her to furnish the capital to
start in the world again.</p>

<p>The fact is well known to those who have taken
the trouble to inquire into the subject, that several of
the more fashionable fortune-tellers of the city sustain
this sort of illicit relation to certain “sporting
men,” whose faces a man may see, perhaps, half a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
dozen times in the course of a lounge up and down
Broadway of a pleasant afternoon.</p>

<p>Madame Clifton is, on the whole, a comely woman,
and does a good business, but of course no sane person
will think of applying these remarks personally
to that respected matron.</p>

<p>The “Individual” paid a lengthened visit to
Madame Clifton, and his remarks are recorded below.
Because he met a sleek, close-shaved, finely moustached
gentleman coming away from the door, he was
of course not justified in believing that the said gentleman
belonged to the establishment. Of course
not.</p>

<p>The female professors of the black art hitherto
visited by the Cash Customer, had not impressed him
with a profound belief in their supernatural powers;
he was “anxious,” and was “awakened to inquiry,”
but he still had doubts, and there was great danger
of his backsliding if there wasn’t something immediately
done for him.</p>

<p>He had been greatly disappointed by the absence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
from the domiciles of these good ladies of all the traditional
necromantic implements and tools. His disposition
to adhere to the modern witch-faith would have
been greatly strengthened by the sight of a skull and
cross-bones; a tame snake, or a little devil in a bottle,
would have fixed his wavering belief; and his conversion
would have been thoroughly assured by the
timely exhibition of a broomstick on which he could
see the saddle-marks.</p>

<p>None of these things had as yet been forthcoming,
and the anxious inquirer, mourning the departure of
all the romance of the art of witchcraft, was fast sinking
into a state of incurable scepticism on the subject
of even its utility, in the degenerate hands of modern
practitioners. Hope had not, however, entirely deserted
his heart, but still retained her fabled position
in the bottom of his chest, near that important viscus,
and he, therefore, courageously continued his pursuit
of witchcraft under difficulties.</p>

<p>His next visit was to Orchard street, and he was
induced to expect favorable results by the encouraging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
and positive assertion which concludes the subjoined
advertisement, that “Madame Clifton is no humbug:”</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">An Astrologist that beats the World</span>, and $5,000 reward
is offered to pay any person who can surpass her in giving correct
statements on past, present, and future events, particularly
absent friends, losses, lawsuits, &amp;c. She also gives lucky numbers.
She surpasses any person that has ever visited our city.
She is also making great cures. All persons who are afflicted
with consumption, liver complaint, scrofula, rheumatism, or any
other lingering disease, would do well to call and see this wonderful
and natural gifted lady, and you will not go away dissatisfied.
N.B.—Madame Clifton is no humbug. Call and satisfy
yourselves. Residence No. 185 Orchard-st., between Houston
and Stanton.”</p></div>

<p>Although Orchard Street is by no means so objectionable
a thoroughfare as human ingenuity might
make it, still, in spite of its pleasant-sounding name, it
is not altogether a vernal paradise. If there ever was
any fitness in the name it must have been many years
ago, and the ancient orchard bears now no fruit, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
low brick houses of assorted sizes and colors, seedy,
and, in appearance, semi-respectable. Occasionally a
blacksmith’s shop, a paint room, or a livery stable,
lower or meaner and more contracted than their neighbors,
look as if they never got ripe, but had shrivelled
and dropped off before their time.</p>

<p>The street is in a state of perennial bloom with
half-built dwellings like gaudy scarlet blossoms, which
are ripened into tenements by the fostering care of
masons and carpenters with the most industrious
forcing; and buds of buildings are scattered in every
direction, in the shape of mortar-beds and piles of
brick and lumber, waiting the due time for their
architectural sprouting.</p>

<p>The house of Madame Clifton is of moderate
growth, being but two stories high; it has a red brick
front and green window-blinds, and is so ingeniously
grafted to its nearest neighbor that some little care is
necessary to determine which is the parent stock. It
presents a fair outside, is but little damaged by age or
weather, and is seemingly in a state of good repair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>A neat-looking colored girl answered the bell, and,
showing our reporter into the parlor, asked his business,
and if he “knew Madame Clifton’s terms?”</p>

<p>Now when it is understood that fortune-telling is
by no means the only, or the most lucrative part of
Madame Clifton’s business, it will be perceived that
this inquiry had a peculiar significance. Having the
fear of libel suits before his eyes, the Individual cannot
state in precise and plain terms the exact nature of
the business which the colored girl evidently thought
had brought him there; he will content himself with
delicately insinuating, that if his errand had been of
the nature insinuated by that female delegate from
Africa, there would have been a “lady in the case.”</p>

<p>Fortunately the Cash Customer had erred not thus,
but he made known to the colored lady his simple
business.</p>

<p>Learning that he only wanted to have his fortune
told by the Madame, and had no occasion to test her skill
in the more expensive departments of her profession,
the girl appeared to be satisfied of the responsibility<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
of her visitor for that limited amount, and departed
to inform her mistress.</p>

<p>The customer took an observation.</p>

<p>The room was a neatly-furnished parlor, a little
flashy perhaps in the article of mirrors, but the sofas,
chairs, carpet, &amp;c., were plain and not offensive to
good taste. A piano was in the room, but it was
closed, and its tone and quality are unknown. One
curious article, for a parlor ornament, stood in the corner
of the room; it was the huge sign-board of a perfumery
store, and bore in large letters the name of
a dealer in sweet-scented merchandise, blazoned
thereon in all the finery of Dutch metal and bronze.
This conspicuous article, though mysterious and
unaccountable, was not cabalistic, and savored not of
witchcraft.</p>

<p>Presently the quiet colored girl returned, and in a
low voice, and with a subdued well-trained manner,
invited her visitor to follow her; meekly obeying, he
was led up two flights of respectable stairs into a
room wherein there was nothing mysterious, nor was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
there anything particularly suggestive except a large
glass case filled with a stock of perfumery. What
was the propriety of so very many bottles filled with
perfumes and medicines did not at first appear; but
the assortment of imprisoned odors, and liquid drugs,
and the store-sign down stairs, and Madame Clifton,
and a certain perfumery store in Broadway, and the
proprietor thereof, so tangled themselves together in
the brain of the inquirer that he has never since that
time been able to disconnect one from the other.</p>

<p>Upon a small stand were two packs of cards—the
one an ordinary playing pack, and the other what are
known sometimes as fortune-telling cards. The
devices on these latter differed materially from those
in ordinary use; there were no plain cards; every
one was ornamented with some kind of a significant
design; there were pictures of women, of men, of
ships and raging seas, of hearses, and sickbeds, and
shrouds, and coffins, and corpses, and graves, and
tombstones, and similar cheerful objects; then there
were squares, and circles, and hands with scales, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
hands with daggers, and hands sticking through
clouds, and purses of money, and carriages, and
moons, and suns, and serpents, and hearts, and Cupids,
and eyes, and rays of light coming from nowhere, and
shining on nothing, and Herculeses with big clubs, and
big arms, bigger than the clubs, and big legs, bigger
than both together, and swords, and spears, and sundials,
and many other designs equally intelligible and
portentous.</p>

<p>Soon the Madame appeared, and the attention of
the Individual was immediately diverted from surrounding
objects and riveted on the incomprehensible
woman who was “no humbug,” and who, according
to her own opinion of herself, would have exactly
realized Mr. Edmund Sparkler’s idea of a “dem’d fine
woman, with nobigodnonsense about her.”</p>

<p>On the first glance, Madame Clifton is what would
be called “fine-looking,” but she does not analyse
well. She is of medium height, aged about thirty-five
years, with very light, piercing blue eyes, and very
black hair, one little lock of which is precisely twisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
into a very elaborate little curl, which rests in the
middle of her forehead between her eyes, as if to keep
those quarrelsome orbs apart. Her eyebrows are
unusually heavy, so much so as to give a curious
menacing look to the upper part of her face, which
disagreeable expression is intensified by the extreme
paleness of her countenance.</p>

<p>Her dress was unassuming, neat, and tasteful, save
in the one article of jewelry, of which she wore as
much as if the stock in trade at the Broadway perfumery
store had been pearls, and gold, and diamonds,
instead of perfumes and essences. Her deportment
was self-possessed and lady-like, that is, if an expression
of tireless watchfulness and unsleeping suspicion
are consistent with refined and easy manners. She
never took her steel-blue eyes from her visitor’s face;
she did not for an instant relax her confident smile;
she did not speak but in the lowest softest tones; but
her auditor felt every instant more convinced that
the voice was the falsest voice he ever heard, the
smile the falsest smile he ever saw, and that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
cold piercing eye alone was true, and that was only
true because no art could conceal its calculating
glitter.</p>

<p>If one could imagine a smiling cat, Madame Clifton
would resemble that cat more than any one thing in
the world. Neat and precise in her outward appearance;
not a fold of her garments, not a thread of lace
or ribbon, not a hair of her head, but was exactly
smooth and orderly, and in its exact place; not a
glance of her eye that was not watchful and suspicious;
not a tone or word that was not treacherous
in sound; not a movement of body or of limb that
was not soft and stealthy; her feline resemblances
developed themselves more and more every instant,
until at last the Individual came to regard her as
some kind of dangerous animal in a state of temporary
and perfidious repose. And this impression
deepened every instant, so much so, that when the
small soft hand was laid in his, he almost expected
to see the sharp claws unsheathe themselves from the
velvet finger-tips and fasten in his flesh.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>The language she used, when freed from the technical
phrases of her trade, was good enough for every
day, and she did not distinguish herself by any specialty
of bad English.</p>

<p>She asked her customer, with her most insinuating
smile, if he would have her “run the cards for him,”
and on receiving an affirmative answer she took the
pack of playing cards into her velvet hands, pawed
them dexterously over a few times to shuffle them,
laid them in three rows with the faces upward, and
softly purred the following words:</p>

<p>“I am uncertain whether to run you a club or a
diamond, for I do not exactly see how it is; but I
will run you a club first, and if you find that it does
not tell your past history, please to mention the fact
to me, and I will then run you a diamond.”</p>

<p>She then proceeded to mention a number of fictitious
events which she asserted had happened in the
past life of her listener, but that individual, who did
not find that her revelations agreed with his own
knowledge of his former history, tremblingly informed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
her of that fact; and she then, with a most
vicious contraction of the overhanging eyebrows,
broke short the thread of her fanciful story, and
proceeded to “run him a diamond.”</p>

<p>She evidently was determined to make the diamond
come nearer the truth—to which end she dexterously
strove by a series of very sharp cross-questionings to
elicit some circumstance of his early history, on which
she might enlarge, or to get some clue to his present
circumstances, and hopes, and aspirations, that she
might find some peg on which to hang a prediction with
an appearance of probability. The Individual—with
humiliation he confesses it—was a bachelor. His heart
had proved unsusceptible, and Cupid had hitherto failed
to hit him. On this occasion he proved characteristically
unimpressible; and the insinuating smile, the
inquiring look, and the winning manner, all failed of
effect, and he remained pertinaciously non-committal.</p>

<p>Finding this to be the case, the feline Madame
changed her tactics, and, as if to spite her intractable
customer, began to prophesy innumerable ills and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
evils for him. She apparently strove to mitigate, in
some degree, the sting of her predictions by an increased
softness of manner, which was only a more
cat-like demeanor than ever. She spoke as follows—the
cold eye growing more cruel, and the wicked
smile more treacherous every instant. First, however,
came this guileful question, which was but a declaration
of war under a flag of truce:</p>

<p>“You do not want me to flatter you, do you?
You want me to tell you exactly what I see in the
cards, do you not?” The customer stated that he was
able to bear at least the recital of his future adversity,
even if, when the reality came, he should be utterly
smashed; whereupon she proceeded:</p>

<p>“I see here a great disappointment; you will be
disappointed in business, and the disappointment will
be very bitter and hard to bear—but that is not all,
nor the worst, by any means. I see a burial—it may
be only a death of one of your dearest friends, or
some near relative, such as your sister, but I see that
you yourself are weak in the chest and lungs; you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
are impulsive, proud, ambitious, and quick-tempered,
which last quality tends much to aggravate any diseases
of the chest, and I fear that the burial may be
your own. Your disease is serious, you cannot live
long, I think—I do not think you will live a year—in
fact, there is the strongest probability that you will
die before nine months. I think you will certainly
die before nine months, but if you survive, it will
only be after a most severe and painful illness, in the
course of which you will undergo the extreme of
human suffering. I see that you love a light-complexioned
lady, but her friends object to her marriage
with you, and are doing all they can to prevent it.
A dark-complexioned man is trying to get her away
from you; you must beware of him or he will do you
great injury, for he has both the will and the power;
he has already deceived and injured you, and will do
so again even more deeply than he has yet. I see a
journey, trouble, and misfortune, grief, sorrow, heavy
loss, and heaviness of heart. I again tell you that
you will die before nine months; but if you chance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
to survive, it will only be to encounter perpetual
crosses and misfortunes. I might, if I was disposed
to flatter you and give you false hopes, tell you that
you will be lucky, fortunate in business, that you will
get the lady, and I might promise you all sorts of
good luck, but I don’t want to flatter you; it would
be much more agreeable to me to tell you a good life,
for it sometimes pains me more than I can tell you to
read bad lives to people, and I feel it very deeply;
but I assure you that I never saw anybody’s cards
run as badly as do yours—I never saw so many losses
and crosses, and so much trouble and misfortune in
anybody’s cards in my whole life—even if you outlive
the nine months you will have the greatest trouble in
getting the lady, and will always have bad luck.”</p>

<p>She then tried by means of the cards to spell out
the Inquirer’s name, but failed utterly, not getting a
single letter right; then she recommenced and threatened
him with so much bad luck that he began almost
to fear that he would break his leg before he rose
from his chair, or would instantly fall down in a fit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
and be carried off to die at the Hospital. She told
him that his lucky days were the 1st, 5th, 17th, 27th,
and 29th of every month. Then perceiving that his
feelings were deeply moved by the intractability of
the “cruel parients” of the light-complexioned lady,
and the black look of things generally, she slightly
relented, and went on to say:</p>

<p>“If you will put your trust in me, and take my
advice as a friend, I can sell you something that will
surely secure you the lady, and thwart all your enemies—it
is not for my interest that I tell you this, for
upon my honor I make only five shillings upon fifty
dollars’ worth—it is no trick, but it is a charm which
you must wear about you, and which you must wish
over about the girl at stated times, and it will be sure
to have the desired effect.”</p>

<p>The customer asked the price of this wonderful
charm.</p>

<p>“It is from five to fifty dollars, but as you are so
extraordinarily unlucky I would advise you to take
the full charm. It is the <i>Chinese Ruling Planet
Charm</i>, and I import it from China at great expense.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
You must wear it about you, and every time you use
it you must do it in the name of God; so you see
there can be no demon about it. By means of this
charm I have brought together husbands and wives
who have been apart for three years, and I say a woman
who can do that is doing good, and there is no
demon about her. While you wear it you will not
die or meet with bad luck, but it will change the
whole current of your life.”</p>

<p>She then told her unlucky hearer to make a wish
and she would tell him by the cards whether he could
have it or not. The answer was in the negative, and
it was evident that nothing but the <i>Chinese Ruling
Planet Charm</i> would save him, and no less than $50
worth of that. So the smiling Madame returned to
the charge. “If you will take my advice as a friend,
take the charm; it is for your sake only that I say
this, for I make nothing by it—but I feel an interest
in you, and I wish you would buy the charm for my
sake as well as your own, for I want to see its effect
on a fortune so bad as yours. If you don’t buy it,
and all kinds of ill-fortune befalls you, don’t say I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
didn’t warn you, and don’t call Madame Clifton a
humbug; but if you do buy it, you may be sure that
you will ever bless the day you saw Madame Clifton.”</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, needless to state that the Individual
didn’t have with him the fifty dollars to pay
for the charm, but intimated that he would call
again, after he got his year’s salary.</p>

<p>She then said: “If you happen to call when I am
engaged, tell the girl to say that you want to see me
about <i>medicine</i>, and I will see you, for I never put
off anybody who wants <i>medicine</i>, no matter who is
with me, say <i>medicine</i>, and I will see you instantly.”
Here she softly showed her visitor to the door, and
smiled on him until he stood on the outside steps.
He then departed, secretly wondering what kind of
“medicine” she was prepared to furnish in case any
unlooked for occasion should suggest a second call.
Her last remark suggested that Madame Clifton
derives a larger profit from the peculiar kinds of
“<i>medicine</i>” she deals in, than from all her other
witchery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

of No. 80 West 19th Street, and how she covered<br />

<hr />

<h3>MADAME HARRIS, No. 80 WEST 19<span class="smcap">th</span> STREET,
NEAR SIXTH AVENUE.</h3>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Madame Harris</span> is one of the most ignorant and
filthy of all the witches of New York. She does not
depend entirely on her “astrology” for her subsistence,
but relies on it merely to bring in a few dollars
in the spare hours not occupied in the practice of the
other dirty trades by which she picks up a dishonest
living. She has a good many customers, and in one
way and another she contrives to get a good deal of
money from the gullible public. She has been
engaged in business a number of years, and has
thriven much better than she probably would, had
she been employed in an honester avocation.</p>

<p>The “Individual” paid her a visit, and carefully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
noted down all her valuable communications; he has
told the whole story in the words following:</p>

<p>We all believe in Aladdin, and have as much
faith in his uncle as in our own; but we don’t know
the pattern of his lamp, we have no photograph of
the genii that obeyed it, and we can make no correct
computation of the market value of the two hundred
slaves with jars of jewels on their heads. The
customer, who is determined that posterity shall be
able to make no such complaint of him or of his
history, here solemnly undertakes, upon the faith
of his salary, to relate the unadorned truth, and to
indulge in no <i>ad libitum</i> variations—imagining, while
he writes, that he sees in the distance the critical
public, like a many-headed Gradgrind, singing out
lustily for “Facts, sir, facts.”</p>

<p>The next fact, then, to be investigated and sworn
to, is this Madame Harris, a very dirty female fact
indeed, residing in the upper part of the city, and
advertising as follows:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Madame Harris.</span>—This mysterious Lady is a wonder to
all—her predictions are so true. She can tell all the events
of life. Office, No. 80 West 19th-st., near 6th-av. Hours
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Ladies 25 cts.; Gentlemen 50 cts. She
causes speedy marriages; charge extra.”</p></div>

<p>Wearily the inquirer plodded his way on foot to
West 19th Street, fearing to trust himself to a stage
or car, lest the careless conversation of the unthinking,
and the reprehensible jocularity of the little boys
who hang about the corners of the streets which
intersect the Sixth Avenue, and pelt unwary passengers
with paving-stones, should divert his mind from
the importance and great moral responsibility of his
mission.</p>

<p>After encountering a large assortment of the dangers
and discomforts incident to pedestrianism in
New York in muddy weather, he achieved West
19th street, and stood in sight of the mysterious
domicile of Madame Harris.</p>

<p>It is a tenement house, shabby-genteel even in its
first pretentious newness; but it has now lost its former
appearance even of semi-respectability, and has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
degenerated to a state of dirt only conceivable by
those unhappy families who live two in a house, and
are in a constant state of pot-and-kettle war, and of
mutual refusing to clean out the common hall.</p>

<p>A little mountain of potato skins, and bones, and
other kitchen refuse, round which he was forced to
make a detour, plainly said to the traveller that the
population of the house No. 80 were in the habit of
depositing garbage in the gutters, under cover of the
night, and in violation of the city ordinance. A
highly-perfumed atmosphere surrounds this delightful
abode, for the first floor thereof is occupied as a
livery stable, which constantly exhales those sweet
and pungent odors peculiar to equine habitations.</p>

<p>Pulling the sticky bell-handle with as dainty a
touch as possible, the Individual was admitted by a
slatternly weak-eyed girl of about eighteen, with her
hair and dress as tumbled as though she had just
been run through a corn-shelling machine, and who
was so unnecessarily dirty that even her face had not
been washed. She was further distinguished by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
wart on her nose of such shape and dimensions that
it gave her face the appearance of being fortified by a
many-sided fort, which commanded the whole countenance.</p>

<p>This interesting young female welcomed her visitor
with a clammy “Come in,” and led the way up stairs,
he following, in due dread of being for ever extinguished
by an avalanche of unwashed keelers and
kettles, which were unsteadily piled up on the landing,
and which an incautious touch would have toppled
over, and deluged the stairs with unknown sweet-smelling
compounds, whose legitimate destination
was the sewer. On the second floor, directly, judging
from the noise, over the stall of the balkiest
horse in the stable below, is the room of the
Madame.</p>

<p>The customer took an observation:</p>

<p>The furnishings of the apartment showed an
attempt to keep up a show, which was by far too
miserably transparent to hide the slovenliness which
peeped out everywhere through the tawdry gilding.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
There were so many oil paintings on the walls, in
such gaudy frames, that it seemed as if the room had
been dipped into a bath of cheap auction pictures, and
hadn’t been wiped dry, or had been out in a shower
of them, and hadn’t come in until it had got very
wet. A broad gilt window cornice stood leaning in
the corner of the room, instead of being in its legitimate
place; a pair of lace curtains were wadded up
and thrown in a chair, while the windows were
covered with the commonest painted muslin shades;
a piano-stool stood in the middle of the room, but
there was no piano.</p>

<p>These were the indications of “better days;” these
were the shallow traps set to inveigle the beholder
into a belief in the opulence of the occupants of this
charming residence.</p>

<p>But the little cooking-stove, on which two smoothing
irons were heating, the scraps of different patterned
carpets which hid the floor, and made it
appear as if covered with some kind of variegated
woollen chowder, the second-hand, conciliating please-buy-me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
look of the three chairs, and the dirt and
greasy grime which gave a character to the place,
told at once the true state of facts.</p>

<p>On one side of the room was a little door, evidently
communicating with a closet or small bedroom; on
this door was a slip of tin, on which was painted</p>

<div class="bbox" style="width: 16em">
<p>Office.—Madam Harris, Astrologist.</p>
</div>

<p class="ni">and into this “office” the weak-eyed girl disappeared,
with a shame-faced look, as if she had tried to steal
her visitor’s pocket-book, and hadn’t succeeded. Presently
there came from the closet a sound of half-suppressed
merriment, as if a constant succession of
laughs were born there, full grown and boisterous,
but were instantly garroted by some unknown power,
until each one expired in a kind of choky giggle.
There was also a noise of the making of a bed, the
hustling of chairs, the putting away of toilet articles
out of sight, and over all was heard the chiding voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
of Madame Harris, who was evidently dressing herself,
superintending these other various operations,
and scolding the weak-eyed maiden all at once.</p>

<p>At last this latter individual got so far the better
of her jocularity that she was able to deport herself
with outward seriousness when she emerged from the
mysterious closet, and said to the Individual, “Walk
in.” At this time she was under so great a head of
laugh that she would inevitably have exploded, had
she not, the instant her visitor turned his back, let go
her safety-valve, and relieved herself by a guffaw
which would have been an honor and a credit to any
one of the horses on the first floor.</p>

<p>The room in which Madame Harris was waiting to
receive her customer was so dark that he stumbled
over a chair, and fell across a bed before he could see
where he was. Then he recovered himself, and took
an observation.</p>

<p>The room was a very small one—so diminutive,
indeed, that the bed, which occupied one side of it,
reduced the available space more than two-thirds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
It was partitioned off from the rest of the room by
a dirty patch-work bed-quilt, with more holes than
patches. The walls were scrawled over with pencil-marks,
evidently drawings made by young children,
who had the usual childish notions of proportion and
perspective; and on one side of the wall, near the
head of the bed, a bit of pasteboard persisted in this
startling announcement—</p>

<div class="bbox" style="width: 7em; padding: 0.5em">
<p>tE<i>R</i>ms C<i>a</i>sH</p>
</div>

<p class="ni">A narrow strip of rag carpet was on the floor; a
small stand and a chair completed the furnishing of
the room, and a single smoky pewter lamp exhausted
itself in a dismal combat with the gloom, which
constantly got the better of it.</p>

<p>When the Cash Inquirer stumbled, and took an
involuntary leap into the middle of the bed, an awful
voice came out of the dreariness, saying, “There is a
chair right there behind you.” This information
proved to be correct, and the discomfited delegate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
subsided into it, and gazed stolidly at the Madame.
If Madame Harris were worth as much by the pound
as beef, her market-price would be about twenty-five
dollars. She was attired in a loose morning-gown,
of an exceedingly flashy pattern, open before, disclosing
a skirt meant to be white, but whose cleanliness
was merely traditional. Of her countenance her
visitor cannot speak, for it was carefully hidden from
his inquiring gaze, and its unknown beauties are left
to the imagination of the reader. Perched mysteriously
on the back of her head, where it was retained
by some feminine hocus-pocus, which has ever been a
sealed mystery to <i>man</i>kind, was a little black bonnet,
marvellous in pattern and design; from this depended
a long black veil, covering her countenance, and disguising
her as effectually as if she had washed her
face and put on a clean dress.</p>

<p>She proceeded at once to business, and opened conversation
with this appropriate remark: “My terms
is fifty cents for gentlemen, and the pay is always in
advance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>”</p>

<p>Here followed a disbursement on the part of the
anxious seeker after knowledge, and an approving
chuckle was heard under the veil.</p>

<p>Taking up a pack of cards so overlaid with dirt
that it was a work of time and study to tell a queen
from a nine spot, or distinguish the knaves from the
aces, she presented them with the imperative remark:
“Cut them once.”</p>

<p>Then ensued the following wonderful predictions
uttered by a dubious and uncertain voice under the
veil—which voice seemed one minute to come from
the mouth, then it issued from the throat, then it
sprawled out of the stomach, then it was heard from
the back of the head under the bonnet, and in the
course of a few minutes it came from so many places,
that the puzzled hearer was dubious as to its exact
whereabouts—these curious effects being, doubtless,
attributable to the thick covering over the face. But
its various communications, when gathered together,
were found to sum up as follows:</p>

<p>“You face back misfortune and trouble, of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
you have had much, but they are now behind you,
and you have no more to fear. You will henceforth
be successful in business, you will have a great deal
of money. Your affection card faces up a young
woman with dark eyes and dark hair, about twenty-three
years old; she is older than she has led you to
believe; there is a dark-complexioned man whom you
will see in two days, who is your enemy; you may
not know it, but you had better beware of him, for
he will do you an injury, if he can; you will see him
and speak with him the night of day-after-to-morrow.
Your marriage card faces up this dark woman, as I
said before. I don’t see a great deal of money layin’
round her, but there is plenty of money layin’ round
you in the future. Somebody will die and leave you
money within nine weeks, not counting this week.
You was born under the planet Mars, which gives
you two lucky days in every week—Mondays and
Thursdays; anything you begin on those days will
surely succeed.”</p>

<p>Here she handed the cards to be cut again, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
operation disclosed a new feature in the Individual’s
matrimonial future, for she went on to say:</p>

<p>“There is another woman who faces your love-card,
who has light hair and light eyes; she favors
your love-card and will be your first wife; you will
have five children—four girls and one boy; look out
for the dark-complexioned man, for he favors your
first wife, and, though she does not favor him very
much, he will try to get her away from you. Your
line of life is long; you will live to be sixty-eight
years old, but you will die very suddenly, for your
line of death crosses your line of life very suddenly,
which always brings sudden death.”</p>

<p>Having given this cheering promise, she again held
out the cards to be cut, and said, “Cut them again
now, and make a wish at the same time, and I will
tell you if you will have your wish.”</p>

<p>When the required ceremony had been solemnly
performed, she continued: “You will have your
wish, but not right away; don’t expect to get it before
week after next, but then you will be sure to have it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
for there is no disappointment in the cards for you.”
She then informed her customer that she always
answered unerringly two questions, which he was now
at liberty to propound. He made a couple of inquiries
relative to his future business prospects, and
received in reply the promise of most gratifying results.</p>

<p>Having then, as he supposed, got his money’s
worth, he was about to take his leave, when she interrupted
him thus:</p>

<p>“I have a charm for securing good luck to whoever
wears it; you can wear it, and your most intimate
friend would never suspect it; my charge is one dollar
for gentlemen; a great many have bought it of
me; many merchants who were on the point of failing
have come to me and possessed this charm, and been
saved; you had better possess it, for it will be sure to
bring you good luck; if you possess it, you will
always be successful in business; Mr. Lynch of Mott
Street possessed it, and has been very lucky ever
since, besides a great number I could name; my
advice to you is, possess the charm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>”</p>

<p>She then put her elbows on her knees after the
manner of a Fulton Market apple-pedler, in which
classic attitude she awaited an answer. The decision
was not favorable to her hopes; for the economical
customer concluded not to invest in the charm,
although it had brought such excellent fortune to Mr.
Lynch of Mott Street. He departed, encountering
again in his progress the weak-eyed one, who met him
with a smile, escorted him to the door with a great
laugh, and dismissed him with a joyous grin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> fortune-tellers so elaborately described in the
foregoing chapters are by no means the only ones in
New York, engaged in that lucrative occupation;
there are several others who were visited by the
Individual, but who in their surroundings approach
so nearly to those already set down, that a detailed
description of each would necessarily be a somewhat
monotonous repetition. So the prophecy only of each
one is here writ down, with a few words suggestive
of the character of the immediate neighborhood,
leaving the imaginative reader to fill up the blank
himself, or to turn back to some foregoing chapter for
a picture of a similar locality, if he prefers it ready-made
to his hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>


<h3 style="padding-top: 1em">MADAME DE BELLINI, No. 159 FORSYTH STREET.</h3>

<p>For the benefit of those not familiar with the
streets of New York, it is perhaps well to mention
that Forsyth Street is a dirty thoroughfare, two
streets east of the Bowery, and that it is filled for the
most part with small groceries, junk shops, swill milk
dispensaries, and stalls for the sale of diseased vegetables
and decaying fruit, and that the inhabitants are
mostly delegates from Africa, and from the Green
Isle of the Sea.</p>

<p>Immediately adjoining the domicil of Madame de
Bellini is a filthy little vegetable store, and on the
opposite corner is an equally filthy Irish grocery,
where are dispensed swill milk and poisoned whiskey.
The residence of the Madame is a low two-story
brick house, of rather better appearance than many
of its neighbors, which are principally wooden buildings
with those old-fashioned peculiar roofs, with little
windows close under the cornice, which make a house
look as if it had had its hat knocked over its eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame de Bellini is a Dutchwoman of very large
dimensions, being a two-hundred-and-fifty-pounder at
the lowest estimate. Like most fat women, she is
good-natured and smiling. She is apparently 35
years old, of pleasant manners, somewhat embarrassed
by the difficulty she has in communicating her
ideas in English, and is much neater in person and
dress than the majority of ladies in the same line of
business. She would be a popular bar-maid at a
lager-bier saloon, and would preside over the fortunes
of the sausage and Swiss cheese table, with eminent
success, and satisfaction to the public.</p>

<p>She welcomed the Cash Customer in a jolly
sort of way, introduced him to her private apartment,
and seated him on a chair at one side of a
little table, while she bestowed herself on a stool
opposite.</p>

<p>Having ascertained that he did not speak German
with sufficient fluency to carry on an animated conversation
in that tongue, or to comprehend a rapidly
spoken discourse delivered therein, she was compelled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
to ventilate her English, which she did, beginning as
follows:</p>

<p>“I speak not vera mooch goot English—I speak
German and French, but no goot English.”</p>

<p>The Individual, with his usual caution, inquired
how much she proposed to charge for her services.
She responded thus:</p>

<p>“I tell your for<i>toon</i> fier ein tollar, or I can tell your
for<i>toon</i> fier ein half-tollar.”</p>

<p>Fifty cents’ worth was enough to begin with, so she
took his left hand in her huge fist, and as a preliminary
operation squeezed it till he gave it up for lost,
and in the intervals of his suffering hastily ran over
in his mind the various ways in which one-handed
people get a living; then she relented and did not
deprive him of that useful member, but said:</p>

<p>“You have goot hand, vera goot hand—your hand
gifs you goot fortoon. You was born under goot
blanet, vera nice blanet, you have vera nice fortoon.
You have mooch rich, vera great monish; you haf
seen drubbles, (trouble) vera mooch drubbles—more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
drubbles you haf seen, as you will see some more—dat
is, you shall not have so many drubbles py and py
as you haf had long ago, for you haf goot blanet.
You will journeys make mooch in footoor (future)
years. You will have two wifes and mooch kindes
(children) in der footoor years, and you will be vera
mooch happy und bleasant mit der wife vot you shall
have der first dime, but not so mooch happy und
bleasant mit der wife vot you shall have der two time,
but you shall vera mooch monish have in der fortoor
years.”</p>

<p>She then released the hand of her visitor, who was
very glad to get it back again, and took up a pack of
cards, which she manipulated in the customary style,
and then said:</p>

<p>“Your carts run vera nice; you have goot carts;
here is a shentleman’s as ish vera goot to you, he is
great friends mit you: here is a letter vot you shall
be come to you right avays vera soon—it ish goot
news to you; you must do joost vot das letter says.
Here ish a brown girls vot lofs (loves) you vera<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
mooch, but you do not lofs dat girls, so much as das
girls lofs you—you will not be der vife of das girl,
for there is anunther girls vot you lofs bretty bad und
you will marry her; she is bretty goot girls und you
will be happy, you will hof lots of kindes mit das
girls. Das girls haf a man now vos lof her vera
mooch—he is was you call das soldier; he lofs her
mooch but he shall not hof her, you shall hof das
girls. Here is great man was will be good friend to
you; he ish vera great man, a big king; not vas you
call der könig, but your big mans, your, vos is
das, your bresident—de bresident bees goot friends
mit you—here is dark mans, he ish no goot friend
mit you, und you must keep away from das dark
mans.”</p>

<p>This was all the information she appeared to derive
from this pack, which were ordinary playing cards, so
she laid them aside and took up the regular fortune-telling
cards, which are covered with various mysterious
devices. These did not seem to communicate
anything of very special importance in addition to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
what she had already said, for she examined them
closely and then merely summed up as follows:</p>

<p>“Goot fortoon, goot blanet, goot vifes, blenty
monish, mooch kindes, not more troubles in der
footoor years, big friends, bresident mooch friends
mit you, lif long, ninety-nine years before you die,
leave fortoon to vife und two kindes.”</p>

<p>The Individual was curious to inquire wherein
the fifty-cent dose he had received, differed from the
fortunes for which she charged “ein tollar,” and he
received the following information:</p>

<p>“For ein tollar I gifs you a charm as you vears on
your necks, und it gifs you goot luck for ever, und
you never gets drownded, und you lifs long viles,
und you bees rich und vera mooch happy.”</p>

<p>The Madame was also good-natured enough to exhibit
one of these powerful charms to her customer.
It was a piece of parchment, originally about four
inches square, but which had been scalloped on the
edges, and otherwise cut and carved; on it were inscribed
in German, several cabalistic words; this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
potent document was to be always worn next the
heart.</p>

<p>Madame de Bellini has been in New York but a
year or two; she speaks French and German, and is
taking lessons in English from an American lady.
She has many customers, mostly German, and, as in
the case of all the other witches, the greatest majority
of her visitors are women.</p>


<h3 style="padding-top: 1em">MADAME LEBOND, No. 175 HUDSON STREET.</h3>

<p>The house in which this woman was sojourning at
the time of the visit hereinafter described, is a boarding-house,
and the room of the Madame is the back
parlor on the second floor.</p>

<p>The Individual was received at the door by a
short, greasy, dirty man, about forty years of age,
who invited him into the front parlor, to wait until
the Madame was disengaged. This man, who is an
ignorant, half-imbecile person, passes for the husband
of the fortune teller, and is known as <i>Doctor</i> Lebond.
He is a man of peculiar appearance; the top of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
head is perfectly bald, and the fringe of hair about
the lower part of it, is twisted into long corkscrew
ringlets, that fall low down on his shoulders.</p>

<p>He informed the customer that the Madame was
then engaged, but he seemed undecided about the
exact nature of her present employment. He first
said she was “tellin’ the futur for a young gal;” then
she was “engaged with a literary man;” then “a dry-goods
merchant wanted to find out if his head clerk
didn’t drink;” but finally he said that “Madame L.
is a eatin’ of her dinner.” After some ingenious
drawing-out, the <i>Doctor</i> vouchsafed the subjoined
statement of his business prospects.</p>

<p>“We seen the time when we hadn’t fifteen minutes
a day, on account of young gals a comin’ for to have
their fortune told; we used to be busy from mornin’
till ten and ’levin o’clock at night a-tellin’ fortunes
an’ a doctorin’—but now, we don’t do so much ’cause
the young gals don’t like to come to a boardin’-house
where young men can see ’em, ’specially in the evenin’.
We’s too public here; the young men a-boardin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>’
here likes for to have the young gals come, they likes
for to see ’em in the parlor, but the young gals won’t
come so much, ’cause we’s too public. We’ll have for
to get another house on account of business.</p>

<p>“I don’t get so much doctorin’ to do as I used to,
’cause we’s too public. I have doctored lots of folks,
principally young fellers and young gals, and I can
do it right. If you ever get into any trouble you’ll
find me and my wife <i>all right</i>; you can come to us—we
mean to be all right, and to give everybody the
worth of their money, and we <i>is</i> all right.”</p>

<p>By this time, Madame Lebond had finished her dinner,
and was waiting in the back parlor. She is a
fat, slovenly-looking woman, forty years old or more,
having no teeth, and taking prodigious quantities of
snuff, which gives her enunciation some peculiar characteristics.</p>

<p>When the Individual first beheld her, she was
standing in the middle of the floor, picking her teeth.
She requested her visitor to take a seat, and to pay
her half-a-dollar, with both of which requests he complied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
She then put into his hand the end of a brass
tube about an inch in diameter and a foot long, and said:
“Give be the tibe of your birth as dear as possible.”</p>

<p>This was done, and the following brief dialogue
ensued:—</p>

<p>“Was you bord id the bording?”</p>

<p>“I really don’t remember.”</p>

<p>“Do you have beddy dreabs?”</p>

<p>“I do not dream much.”</p>

<p>“Thed you dod’t have bad dreabs?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Thed you was bord id the bording,” by which
mysterious word she probably meant, “morning.”
She then continued:—</p>

<p>“You are a pretty keed sbart chap—sharp id busidess,
but dot good id speculatiods, ad you should
codfide your attedtiods to busidess. If you keep od
as you are goidg dow, ad works hard, ad dod’t bix id
bad cobpady, ad is hodest, ad dod’t spend your buddy,
you will be rich. You will travel buch—you <i>have</i>
travelled buch, but your travels is hardly begud;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
there is a lodg jourdey at sea dow before you, ad you
will start od this jourdey bost udexpectedly; you
will always be lucky, ad will be very rich. I dod’t
say dothin’ to flatter do wud; lots of fellers ad gals
cub here ad I tell theb all jest what I see; if I see
bad luck I tell theb so; but yours is all good luck,
ad I see lots of it for you. You have had bad luck
lately, but you will get over your bad luck for you
are a pretty sbardt chap, ad have got a good deal of
abbitiod, ad you go ahead pretty well. You will
barry a gal—a gal as you have seed but dod’t know.
Very well, she is a youdg gal, ad a rich gal, ad a good-lookidg
gal; you will dot barry her for sobe tibe,
but you will barry her at last. She has a beau ad
you will likely have sobe trouble with hib, but you
will get the gal at last. The gal has light hair ad
blue eyes, ad I cad show her to you if you would
like to see her.”</p>

<p>Of course the visitor liked to see her; so he
was directed to clasp the brass tube in his right
hand, and place his hand over the top. Then she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
stepped behind his chair and began to go through
with some extraordinary manual exercises on his
head. She felt of the bumps, she squeezed his head,
punched it, jerked it from side to side, and twisted
it about in every possible direction. What was the
object and intention of this performance she did not
disclose, but when she had kneaded his unfortunate
skull to her satisfaction, she bade him step to the
window and look into the tube.</p>

<p>This he did, and he saw a very dingy-looking
daguerreotype of a fair-haired damsel with blue eyes,
who bore, of course, not the most distant resemblance
to any lady of his acquaintance.</p>

<p>Then the fat Madame had a charm to sell, to be
worn about the neck, and never taken off, in which case
it would secure for the wearer “good luck” for ever.</p>

<p>The Individual declined to purchase and departed,
meeting at the door the curly <i>Doctor</i>, who
once again offered his medical services in case the
stranger ever got into “trouble,” and who once again
assured that person with an air of mystery that “me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
and my wife is all right—yes, you may depend, we
is all right, we is.”</p>


<h3 style="padding-top: 1em">MADAME MAR, AND MADAME DE GORE, No. 176
VARICK STREET.</h3>

<p>These two eminent sorceresses are in partnership,
and drive a tolerably fair trade. They advertise in
the papers, one week the heading being “Madame
Mar, assisted by Madame de Gore,” and the next week,
it will be “Madame de Gore, assisted by Madame
Mar,” and the profits of the business are shared in the
same impartial manner.</p>

<p>The house, No. 176, is in the worst part of Varick
Street, and the room occupied by the pair of witches
is over a boot and shoe store, and a pawnbroker’s
shop is directly opposite.</p>

<p>The room is a small parlor, neatly though plainly
furnished, and with no professional implements visible.
When the inquirer made his call, Madame de Gore
was engaged in the kitchen, in her various household<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
duties, and Madame Mar attended to his call. She is
a tall and rather pleasing woman, neatly dressed and
of quiet manners.</p>

<p>She secured a dollar in advance, and then led her
customer into a little closet-like room, furnished only
with a small table and two chairs. She then
announced that she is a “phrenologist,” and exhibited
a plaster bust with the “bumps” scientifically marked
out, and also some phrenological charts and other
publications. She proceeded to give the character of
her visitor in the usual mode of phrenological examinations,
after which she prophesied as follows:</p>

<p>“You were born between Jupiter and Mars, with
such stars you can never be unlucky, for although you
have seen trouble, it is past. Your luck runs in
threes and fives—that is, you are unlucky three years
in succession, and lucky the five years following.
You are never <i>very</i> unlucky, but you do not do so
well in your third house as in your fifth house. You
could not be unlucky in your fifth house if you tried.
You have now two months to run in your third<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
house, then comes on your fifth house. Just now
your life seems to be under a cloud, but after two
months you will come out bright and will enjoy five
years of clear sunshine, and you will then be very
wealthy. You will have more money then than you
ever will again, though you will always have plenty.
Your wealth runs 14 at the end of five years; after
that runs 13½, which is very wealthy. You will
marry a young girl, wealthy and beautiful. You will
raise two daughters, but you will never have a large
family. You will be the father of many children, but
your family will never be more than two children.
You will go in business with a very wealthy Southern
man, his wealth runs 14—he has two sons and a
daughter. You will marry the daughter, though you
will be opposed by the father and one son, but the
other son will stick by you. You will live with that
wife twenty-five years, then she will die and you will
travel with your two daughters. You will go to
Europe. In England you will marry a French
widow. Your two daughters will marry well, and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
72 or 73 years old you will die, leaving a widow, two
daughters, and a large fortune.”</p>

<p>Madame de Gore did not make her appearance at
all, and after Madame Mar had failed to induce her
visitor to pay her an extra dollar for a phrenological
chart, she politely showed him out.</p>


<h3 style="padding-top: 1em">MADAME LANE, No. 159 MULBERRY STREET.</h3>

<p>This distinguished lady lives in a dirty, dilapidated
mansion, at the corner of Grand and Mulberry Streets.
The Cash Customer was admitted by the Madame
herself, who desired him to be seated for a few
minutes, until she had concluded her business with a
boy of about 17 years old, who had called to find out
what would be the winning numbers in the next
Georgia lottery. Two dirty-faced children were playing
about the room, making a great noise.</p>

<p>One corner of the room was fenced off with rough
boards, forming a narrow closet, in which two people
could, with some difficulty, sit down. This was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
astrological chamber; the mystic room into which
visitors were conducted to have their fortunes told.</p>

<p>Madame Lane is of the Irish breed; is red-haired,
freckled, and dirty to a degree. Her dress was
ragged, showing a soiled, dingy petticoat through
the rents.</p>

<p>She seated her customer in the little room, produced
a pack of cards, and proceeded to tell his
future, at times shouting out threats and words of
warning to the noisy brats outside. Then she said:</p>

<p>“You are a man as has seen a great deal of trouble
in the past.”</p>

<p>It will be noticed that this is almost a universal
remark with the witches, probably because it is a
perfectly safe thing to assert of any person in the
world.</p>

<p>“Yes, you have seen trouble in the past, not <i>real</i>
trouble, such as sickness, or losses in business, but
still, trouble, and your mind has been going this way
and that way and t’other way, but now all your
trouble and disappointment is past, and your mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
won’t go this way and that way any more. Stop that
noise you brats or I’ll beat you.” (This to the children.)</p>

<p>“Your cards run lucky, ’cause you were born under
Jupiter, and folks as is borned under Jupiter will
always be lucky in business, in love, and in everything
they undertake. If your business sometimes
goes this way, and that way, and t’other way, it will
all come out right, for when a man is borned under
Jupiter he must be all right in his business, and in
his love, and in his marriage, and in his children.
Young ones stop that noise or I’ll beat you black and
blue. You have had sickness lately and your mind
has been going this way, and that way, and t’other
way, but you need not worry for it will be all right
soon. Children stop that row or clear right out to
the kitchen. Now mind. I tell you. I see a girl
here that loves you very much, but you don’t love
her and won’t marry her, but you will marry another
girl with black whiskers; no, I mean the feller that
is coortin’ her has got black whiskers, and I fear you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
will have trouble with black whiskers if you are not
careful—the girl has got black hair and is miserable
because you don’t write to her. I’m coming after
you, young ones there, with a raw hide and I’ll cut
the skin off your backs. You will marry this gal
and you will be very happy, and will have three
children, which will be joys to you. Children, I’ll
come and kill you in two minutes. And you will
always be prosperous in your business, and you will
be very rich, and you will live to be eighty-five
years old. Now you can cut the cards and make a
wish and I will tell you if it will come true. Yes,
your wish will come true, because you have cut the
knave, and queen, and king—if you’d like a speedy
marriage with the gal I told you of, I’ll fix it for you
for fifty cents extra; children if you don’t shut up
I’ll come and beat you blind.”</p>

<p>The Individual invested a half-dollar as requested,
and received in return a white powder with these
instructions;—</p>

<p>“You will burn that powder just before you get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
into bed, and if you see the gal to-night you won’t
see no change in her, but she will be changed to-morrow.
She is kinder down on you now, but she
loves you though her mind is kinder this way and
that way, but she will be changed toward you to-night
by what I will do after you are gone.”</p>

<p>The customer departed, leaving this fond mother
engaged in an active skirmish with the two children,
both of whom finally escaped into the street with
great howlings.</p>

<p>Madame Lane does a good business. She says
that in pleasant weather she has from twenty-five to
fifty calls a-day, mostly women; but in bad weather
not more than fifteen or twenty, and these of the other
sex. Many of these come only to learn lucky numbers
for lottery gambling, and policy playing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">It</span> has been already mentioned that there are a number
of persons in the city who do more or less in the
fortune-telling way, who never advertise for customers.
These we must leave to their own seclusion;
as our business has been with those who make a
business of this species of swindling, and who use all
manner of arts to entice the curious, or the credulous,
into their dens, there not only robbing them of their
money, but often putting them in the way to be injured
much more deeply. This, of course, is especially
the case with young girls.</p>

<p>In order to give the readers of this book an idea of
the part taken by these fortune-telling women in
many of the terrible dramas of crime constantly enacting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
in city life, an extract showing the <i>modus operandi</i>
is here inserted. It is from one of a series of
very useful little books published in this city, and
entitled, “Tricks and Traps of New York.”</p>

<p>Speaking of New York fortune-tellers, the author
says, having previously indulged in some severe remarks
about “yellow-covered” novels:</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1.5em">“To see how the fortune-teller performs her part,
let us suppose a case:</p>

<p>“A young, credulous girl, whose mind has been
poisoned by the class of fictions above referred to, is
induced to visit a modern witch, for the purpose of
having her ‘fortune told.’ The woman is very
shrewd, and perceives, in a moment, the kind of customer
she has to deal with. Understanding her business
well, she is perfectly aware that love and marriage—courtship,
lovers, and wedded bliss—are the
subjects which are most agreeable.</p>

<p>“She begins by complimenting her customer: ‘such
beautiful eyes, such elegant hair, such a charming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
form, and graceful manners, are altogether too fine
for a servant or working girl.’ She must surely be
intended for a higher station in life, and she will certainly
attain it. She will rise in the world, by marriage,
and will one day be one of the finest ladies in
the land. Her husband will be the handsomest man
she has ever seen, and her children will be the most
beautiful in the world. Fortune-tellers always foretell
many children to their female customers; for the instinct
of maternity, the yearning desire for offspring,
is one of the strongest feelings of human nature.</p>

<p>“Much more of this sort is said; and if the witch
finds her talk eagerly listened to, she knows exactly
how to proceed. She appoints days for other visits;
for she desires to get as many half-dollars out of her
dupe as she can. Meantime, the girl has been thinking
of what she has heard, has pictured to herself a
brilliant future—a rich husband—every luxury and
enjoyment—and, upon the whole, has built so many
castles in the air, that her brain is half-bewildered.
Even though she may not believe a tittle of what is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
said to her, feminine curiosity will generally lead her
to make a second visit; and when the fortune-teller
sees her come upon a like errand a second time, she
sets down her prey as tolerably sure and lays her
plans accordingly.</p>

<p>“She goes on to state to the girl, in her usual rigmarole
style, that she will, in a few weeks, meet with a
lover; and perhaps she may receive a present of
jewelry; and by that she will know that the ‘handsome
young man’ has seen, and been smitten by her
many charms.</p>

<p>“When the half-believing girl has gone, the scheming
sorceress calls to her aid her confederate in the
game—the party who is to personate ‘the handsome
young man.’ This is usually a spruce-looking fellow,
who makes this particular kind of work his
regular business; or it may be some rich debauchee,
who is seeking another victim, will come and lie in
wait, either behind the curtain or in the next room,
where, through some well-contrived crevice, he can
see and hear all that is going on. One or the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
of these men it is that is to assist the witch in fulfilling
her prophecies; who is, at the proper time, to
be in the way to personate the ‘young beau,’ or
‘rich southerner,’ and to induce her to visit a house
of assignation, or, in some way, accomplish her ruin.</p>

<p>“Persons who have been puzzled to know how
many of the young fellows get their living who are
seen about town, always well dressed, and with
plenty of cash, and yet having no apparently respectable
means of living, will find a future solution
of their questions in this explanation. Many of
these men are ‘kept’ by their mistresses, or by
the proprietors of houses of ill-fame; in the latter
case, to make acquaintance with strangers, and to
bring business to those houses. They are often very
fine-looking and well-appearing men, and possessed
of good natural abilities; but, from laziness or crime,
or some other cause, adopt the meanest possible business
a man can stoop to. Humiliating as this may
seem, and degrading as it is to poor human nature,
what we state is, nevertheless, the literal truth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, to come back to our supposed case. A few
days after her visit to the witch, the girl actually
does, perhaps, receive a present, as the witch predicted;
this not only pleases her vanity and love of
admiration, but disposes her to put confidence in the
powers of the fortune-teller to read coming events.
Straightway the deluded girl goes again to the witch,
to tell how things have fallen out, as she foretold,
and to seek further light upon the subject. It is now
the cue of the prophetess to describe the young man.
This she does in glowing terms; never failing to
endow him with a large fortune; and the poor girl
goes away with her head more turned than ever.”</p>

<hr style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em" />

<p>“Enraptured with a description, or sight of the
picture of her fond love, the deluded girl is now all
anxiety to see him in person. The witch accordingly
gives her some magical powder (price one dollar),
which she is to put under her pillow every night for
seven nights, or wear next her heart for nine days, or
some other nonsense of that kind, at the end of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
which time, she is told to take the ferry-boat to
Hoboken or some such place, at a certain hour in the
afternoon, and somewhere on her route she will have
a sight of the gentleman she is almost crazed to see.
The result is plain, the ‘gentleman’ is there as
foretold, an acquaintance is commenced, and the girl
is ultimately ruined.</p>

<p>“We have been thus particular to give, step by
step, the details of the mode of management pursued
in these cases. There are, of course, many varieties,
dictated by the circumstances of each case, but the
general features and the <i>result</i>, are the same.</p>

<p>“The incidents above given are the outlines of a
real case in which the end of the conspirators was
accomplished; the girl, however, was rescued by the
Managers of the Magdalen Asylum, and is now leading
a blameless life.”</p>

<p>The “Individual” has now concluded his labors,
and he hopes not without profit to the community at
large.</p>

<p>He has heard it urged that this book will merely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
advertise the fortune-tellers, and that they will go on
driving a more flourishing trade than ever. He cannot
think that this will be the case; he cannot believe
that any persons who read in this book the candid
exposition of the style of necromancy dealt out by
the modern Circes, will be willing to pay money for
any personal experience of them, and he respectfully
submits that although they have heretofore been consulted
by many ladies of respectability, from motives
of mere curiosity, those ladies will risk no further
visits when they learn that they may with as much
propriety visit any other assignation house, as a
fortune-teller’s den.</p>

<p>A recapitulation of the various prophecies made to
the Cash Customer would show that he has been
promised thirty-three wives, and something over
ninety children—that he was brought into the world
on various occasions between 1820 and 1833—that
he was born under nearly all the planets known to
astronomers—that he has more birth-places than he
has fingers and toes—that he has passed through so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
many scenes of unexpected happiness and complicated
misfortune in his past life, that he must have lived
fifty hours to the day and been wide awake all the
time—and he has so many future fortunes marked
out for him that at three hundred and fifty years old
his work will not be half done, and when at last all
<i>is</i> finally accomplished, a minute dissection of his
aged corpus will be necessary, that his earthly
remains may be buried in all the places set down
for him by these prophets.</p>

<p>But aside from a humorous contemplation of the
subjects, he trusts he has done his work well; he is
sure he has done it faithfully, and he honestly hopes
that some good may come of his labors to write
down here honestly the ignorance and imbecility of
The Witches of New York.</p>
